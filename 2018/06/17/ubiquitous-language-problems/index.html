<div class="entry-content"><p>Language is tricky. Take the this post, for instance. It&rsquo;s not about language
problems that are ubiquitous. It&rsquo;s about problems related to <em>Ubiquitous
Language</em> &mdash; whether the problems themselves are ubiquitous or not.</p>

<p>Ubiquitous Language is a term from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain-Driven Design</a> software
development practice. It refers to a set of well-defined project terms shared
by all participants: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_expert">Domain experts</a>, business analysts, developers,
users. The term was coined by Eric Evans in his <a href="http://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/">DDD book</a>. I haven&rsquo;t
actually read it, but the idea seems sensible: If developers live and breathe
the domain by speaking its language, their output is more likely to fit the
business needs, and developers and domain experts are more likely to understand
one another.</p>

<p>As a business analyst and developer, your task is to adopt the language of the
domain experts, <em>not</em> the other way around. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean that the
domain experts are home free. Changes are probably required to turn their
jargon into a well-defined set of terms that will ensure precise and
unambiguous communication in the project and to the users. Here are some of the
challenges I&rsquo;ve encountered in this process.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Two.Words..One.Concept"></a>
<h2>Two Words, One Concept</h2>

<p>One problem is that people may use different words for the same concept. It is
preferable to use one word per concept, because it will simplify design
discussions and remove confusion arising from the possibility that the words
<em>could</em> have different meanings. The code and the user interface will also be
much easier to understand for developers and users, respectively, if a concept
always has the same name.</p>

<p>As an example, different project participants use the terms User and Employee.
If the business or system has only employees as users, either word is fine.
Picking one over the other risks having a winner and a loser in the process.
Sometimes finding a third term can be a good move, politically or socially.
Perhaps the term Account can cover the concept and satisfy both parties.</p>

<p>Other times, it turns out that the terms actually have different meanings.
Maybe not all users are employees or not all employees are users. In this case,
both terms can stay in the vocabulary, and their exact relationship will have
to be uncovered.</p>

<a name="One.Word..Two.Concepts"></a>
<h2>One Word, Two Concepts</h2>

<p>Another problem is that the same word may be used for different concepts.
Sometimes by different people, sometimes even by the same people. Take the term
Account from the previous section. There, it was taken to mean a user account.
But Account could also mean a bank account, or a even a client (one managed by
an account manager).</p>

<p>If the main business domain (such as banking, accounting, customer relationship
management) already has a specific interpretation of the term, the other
meanings should probably find other names (such as Client, User Account, or
Bank Account). I prefer avoiding partially overlapping terms, so if Account is
already taken, User is better than User Account &mdash; unless User also has
a meaning distinct from User Account.</p>

<a name="Types.and.Instances"></a>
<h2>Types and Instances</h2>

<p>A specific version of the One Word, Two Concepts problem is when the same word
is used about both instances and types. Perhaps the word Service is used about
a service provided to a customer on a specific date and time (such as
a haircut), but also about the type of service the company provides (such as
a haircut). Or Product can mean both a product from the product catalog and
a product in the context of a specific Order.</p>

<p>For these examples, possible concept names could be Service and Service Type as
well as Product and Order Product. It&rsquo;s a first step, but as easy as it is to
add a prefix or suffix, as easy it drop it again in conversation. A better
option is to choose names that don&rsquo;t have anything in common. An Order Product
could be an Order Line (which is actually a well-known concept). A Service
could be an Appointment, while the term Service refers to the type. Or perhaps
Service stays in the appointment interpretation, and Service Type could be
named Function.</p>

<a name="Software.Development.as.Domain"></a>
<h2>Software Development as Domain</h2>

<p>Service and Function are not to be confused with what a software developer
might understand by these terms. Software is a business domain on its own
right, but unless the <em>project&rsquo;s</em> domain is software, developers should let the
business domain take precedence.</p>

<p>It might be necessary for developers to discuss technical design involving
software terms that clash with the domain model (such as Class, Strategy,
Factory, Visitor). It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to rename well-known concepts from the
software domain, but unless the domain experts need to know about them, they
shouldn&rsquo;t be part of the domain model, and so they should only be used
internally between technical designers and developers.</p>

<p>But even inside the software domain, I have observed the One Word, Two Concepts
problem at work. The term Entity, itself used in DDD, can refer to both a type
and an instance. Peter Chen, who introduced the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model">Entity-Relationship Model</a>, used the term Entity to mean an instance of
some <em>Entity Type</em>. What I mentioned earlier about dropping suffixes also
applies here, and many people, myself included, use Entity in the type meaning.
Ideally, the instance meaning is then referred to by a different word, such as
Object.</p>

<a name="Microsoft.Dynamics.CRM"></a>
<h2>Microsoft Dynamics CRM</h2>

<p>The Microsoft Dynamics Customer Relationship Management (CRM) software
interests me in two ways in relation to DDD and ubiquitous language.
Superficially, Microsoft CRM uses the terms Entity and Record in the above
mentioned type and instance meanings, respectively. But then in the Danish
translation of the software, they use the Danish word <em>objekt</em> &mdash; not
<em>entitet</em> &mdash; as the translation of Entity. (In fact my colleague recently
found out the whole system is translated by Bing!)</p>

<p>Second, Microsoft CRM is somewhat anti-DDD in the sense that the built-in
customer relationship management domain model can conflict with that of the
user organization. It&rsquo;s possible to adapt the built-in data model with new
entities, attributes, and relationships, and by renaming existing items. But
the renaming only applies to the user interface, not the code and database.
This forces developers to think in terms of the built-in model and to translate
back and forth between that and the organization&rsquo;s domain, which is exactly the
thing ubiquitous language tells you to avoid.</p>

<a name="Multiple.Contexts"></a>
<h2>Multiple Contexts</h2>

<p>In this post I have been touching on the matching of words and concepts, both
in general and in software development. In this, I have been simplifying by
focusing on building a single ubiquitous language and domain model for
a project. Part of DDD is acknowledging that a project can be too large for
a single unified model, and instead of trying to make such a model, you should
allow for multiple <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html">bounded contexts</a> and instead make sure to define
their boundaries and relationships. But inside each single context, make sure
to use one word per concept.</p>

<p>The more I think about it, the more I see that software development is itself
far too large to be a single context. Words such as <em>prototype</em> or
<em>implementation</em> have multiple meanings. A prototype can be a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_prototyping">software product</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prototype">function declaration</a>, or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern">cloneable object</a>. Programmers will understand <em>implementation</em> as the
process of and result of turning the human readable design description into
executable computer code. But implementation can also mean taking that same
executable computer code &mdash; the software product &mdash; and embedding it
successfully in the organization that is going to use it.</p>

<p>So two things are important in achieving clear communication. First, make each
context internally sound, and second, be aware of the existence of multiple
contexts, especially when you are speaking with someone who normally thinks and
works in another context from you.</p>
