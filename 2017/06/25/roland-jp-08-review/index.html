<div class="entry-content"><p>In the early 1980s Roland produced a number of synthesizers that aged into
classics. The flagship Jupiter-8 is perhaps the most famous, used by electronic
artists such as Jean Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, and Moby, as well as pop
artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Abba.</p>

<p>Today, a used Jupiter-8 in good condition can cost more than a new top end
modern synthesizer, which is to say a lot. Luckily, in late 2015 Roland
released miniature versions of these classics, at relatively affordable prices.
Jupiter-8 became JP-08, and I got to own a little piece of music history.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/boutiques.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Three originals (Juno-106, Jupiter-8, JX-3P) above the three new 'Boutique' versions (JU-06, JP-08, JX-03)'><span class='caption-text'>Three originals (Juno-106, Jupiter-8, JX-3P) above the three new &lsquo;Boutique&rsquo; versions (JU-06, JP-08, JX-03)</span></span></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit late for a review, one and a half year after the release, but on the
other hand, the Jupiter-8 came out before I was born, so in comparison, the new
version is still very recent!</p>

<a name="Sound.in.a.Box"></a>
<h2>Sound in a Box</h2>

<p>One might ask why you need a box like this when you can generate the same
sounds in your computer. But the new Roland releases are in fact just software
in boxes &mdash; digital emulations of the original electronics. The point is that
a box with the right buttons, knobs, and sliders makes the experience of sound
exploration tactile and immediate.</p>

<p>Plus, in this age of multi purpose devices, there is just something fascinating
about a device that does just one thing, does it well, and doesn&rsquo;t let you
connect to Facebook.</p>

<a name="A.Small.Box"></a>
<h2>A Small Box</h2>

<p>Compared with the Jupiter-8, the JP-08 is tiny. It has the footprint of an A4
sheet of paper (somewhere between letter and legal for you North Americans),
and that&rsquo;s <em>with</em> the optional mini-keyboard attached. Since it can also be
powered from batteries, that means it&rsquo;s <em>portable</em>. You can bring it on trips,
to the park, or just the sofa. (Or bring it to bed, according to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/junkiexlofficial">JunkieXL</a>!)</p>

<p>As part of the portability, the unit even has a built-in speaker so you can
play it without attaching a sound system or headphones. As practical as this
is, the speaker has no bass and a tendency to make the chassis rattle and
resonate. So I recommend skipping it altogether because that will sound much
better and make you appreciate the unit more.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/jp-08.jpg"></p>

<a name="Too.Small.a.Box"></a>
<h2>Too Small a Box</h2>

<p>The portable coolness however comes at a cost. To fit all of the controls of
the Jupiter-8 into such a small areal, they have been arranged in two rows.
Thus the sliders only have a throw of 1 cm, which means they require delicate
hand movements. This detracts from the overall hand-on experience, even though
they are usable with patience. The worst part is that it&rsquo;s very hard to sweep
the filter or pulse width smoothly.</p>

<p>However diminutive they are, controls dedicated to exactly one sound parameter
provide much of the immediacy of the overall experience. Unfortunately, the
auxiliary controls are tucked away under button combinations &mdash; a few
labelled, most not.</p>

<ul>
<li>The solo/unison/poly mode buttons have moved from dedicated buttons to
(labelled) combinations. This is acceptable because this is not something
you&rsquo;re likely to need to switch quickly.</li>
<li>The portamento settings also glided (pun intended) into a combination, with
the glide time set by sliding the modulation ribbon with the &lsquo;dual&rsquo; button
held down. This is a bit sad, since I could imaging tweaking the glide time
while playing.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s worse for features native to the JP-08 such as delay effect parameters,
transpose, pitch bend range, MIDI channel, and especially keyboard octave
selection which is not easily done while playing the mini keyboard.</li>
<li>Also, the pitch bend and modulation features have devolved: The VCO/VCF
destination sliders and selectors have disappeared, and the crude ribbon
makes it difficult to do smooth or precise pitch bends.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Better.With.a.MIDI.Controller"></a>
<h2>Better With a MIDI Controller</h2>

<p>Many of the above problems can be solved by a separate MIDI controller:</p>

<ul>
<li>More octaves can be played directly, or at least octaves can be selected more
easily</li>
<li>Bigger knobs and sliders can be used to obtain smoother sweeps and precise
parameter input</li>
<li>The portamento glide time can be adjusted with a single knob or slider</li>
<li>The Jupiter-8 hold (sustain) feature, missing from the JP-08, can be mapped
to a button</li>
<li>The Jupiter-8 arpeggiator, also sadly missing from the JP-08, can be restored
with an arpeggiating controller such as the Arturia KeyStep</li>
</ul>


<p>Using a separate controller defeats the portability, but seen from the bright
side it just means you can switch between portability and better control.</p>

<a name="Signal.Routing"></a>
<h2>Signal Routing</h2>

<p>Also lost in the miniaturization were the little orange signal routing hints
scattered around the original Jupiter-8 panel:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/jupiter-8-panel.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Image used with permission from Nikolaus Riehm / Studio Repair'><span class='caption-text'>Image used with permission from Nikolaus Riehm / Studio Repair</span></span></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know of these when I got my JP-08, so it was somewhat confusing. The
source mix knob was the first one I figured out: It mixes between the two only
sound sources &mdash; the two oscillators.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s also routing between the two oscillators. VCO-1 has a &lsquo;cross mod&rsquo;
slider and VCO-2 has a &lsquo;sync&rsquo; switch. What&rsquo;s missing from the panel is the
direction of the routing (and even that routing is going on, if you don&rsquo;t know
what &lsquo;cross mod&rsquo; or &lsquo;sync&rsquo; means).</p>

<p>Cross modulation allows the pitch of VCO-1 to be affected by the pitch of
VCO-2, creating crazy bends or new timbres, depending on the frequency of
VCO-2. Sync allows VCO-2 to return to the start of its cycle at the frequency
of VCO-1, creating new timbres out of existing wave forms. After figuring out
the routing, the JP-08 made a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Perhaps most difficult is keeping track of what the two envelopes control.
ENV-1 can affect the pulse width of both oscillators, the frequency of either
or both oscillators, and the filter cutoff frequency. ENV-2 controls the VCA
and the filter frequency. The filter has a switch choosing which envelope
currently controls the filter.</p>

<a name="Docking.Looks.Better"></a>
<h2>Docking Looks Better</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/jp-08_k-25m.jpg"></p>

<p>The JP-08 itself is a sturdy metal panel on top of a plastic box. In its
unmounted form it appears somewhat naked. Adding the optional K-25m keyboard
module really helps completing the look of the device.</p>

<p>Before I got the keyboard module, the device looked somehow messy and
unfinished on my desk. Now, it makes me smile when I look at it. So I&rsquo;m happy
I got the keyboard module even though it is both expensive and only mediocre as
a keyboard. For use mainly with an external keyboard, the synth can also dock
in the keyboard-less, cheaper DK-01 dock.</p>

<p>Also, the metal surfaces have a satisfying ability to not pick up fingerprints.</p>

<a name="More.Like.JP-04"></a>
<h2>More Like JP-04</h2>

<p>The &lsquo;8&rsquo; in Jupiter-8 meant eight voices. The JP-08 only has four voices,
meaning only 4 notes can sound at the same time. This has irritated a lot of
people, including me. I mean, it&rsquo;s not that I play 9th chords all the time, but
Roland, did you really need to go for the minimum effort here, to try to sell
more boxes?</p>

<p>Roland happily claims that you can connect more units to increase the polyphony
by four each time. This is better than nothing, but it&rsquo;s also only partially
true. Because while you can play 4<em>n</em> notes <em>simultaneously</em>, there&rsquo;s still
voice stealing when you play notes sequentially (which is called&hellip; music&hellip;
you might have heard of it, Roland). That means that if you play a sound that
fades out gradually after lifting your finger from the key, that tail will be
cut off by the next note that starts, if no unused voice is available within
the first 4, <strong>not</strong> 4<em>n</em>, voices. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejpw7GsyAGg">Here&rsquo;s</a> a demonstration.</p>

<p>Since the JP-08 is a (really good) digital simulation of the original analog
electronics, giving it eight voices shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Maybe you&rsquo;d need
a better processor, but compared with the costs of development and production,
that cost should be minimal. And you&rsquo;d have happier users. Then perhaps,
instead of buying another JP-08 and feeling like an idiot, I might have bought
one of the other Boutiques.</p>

<a name="Patch.Selection"></a>
<h2>Patch Selection</h2>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/jp-08-16.jpg' width='' height='' alt='The patch selection button rows of the JU-06 and the JP-08'><span class='caption-text'>The patch selection button rows of the JU-06 and the JP-08</span></span></p>

<p>The four voices bring another annoyance, which we need to take a step back to
understand. The Juno-106, JU-06, Jupiter-8, and JP-08 all have 16 buttons used
for patch selection. The JU-06 has eight bank buttons and eight patch buttons,
leading to a total of 64 patches. (The Juno-106, which I own, additionally has
a group selector multiplying everything by two for 128 patches in total.) On
the Juno-106 and JU-06, a single button press can switch the bank number (the
first digit) and the patch number (the last digit) independently (as well as
the group, on the Juno-106), which is very nice. (The Juno-106 also has a patch
increment pedal input, but I digress).</p>

<p>The JP-08 has eight patch number buttons and eight patch preset buttons.
Choosing one of the 64 patches always requires two consecutive presses of the
patch number buttons. A patch preset on the JP-08 is a layering of two patches
sounding simultaneously, and there are only eight of these. This is also how it
was on the Jupiter-8, except that a Jupiter-8 patch preset could also be
a left/right split between two patches instead of a layering.</p>

<p>A patch preset cuts the polyphony in half, since each note you play uses two
voices. Thus, with the JP-08 having only four voices and no split option, patch
presets are much less useful. You can&rsquo;t even play real chords! You can still
play leads and power chords with your layered sound. However, this could be
accomplished with the &lsquo;dual&rsquo; and &lsquo;upper/lower&rsquo; buttons without reserving eight
buttons for patch presets. Instead, it could have used the faster bank+patch
system like the Juno. (Or better yet, it could just have had eight voices.)</p>

<p>There is one final snafu with the 16 buttons and the way they relate to the
delay effect parameters (level, time, and feedback). Because changing the
parameters is difficult while playing, you are not likely to notice it, but
changing the delay time also flushes the delay buffer. However, if you control
the delay parameters with a knob on a MIDI controller, this becomes
embarrassingly obvious.</p>

<a name="In.Conclusion"></a>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The JP-08 is fun and sounds really good. But there are so many things that feel
like they could have been much better with small changes.</p>

<p>Eight voices, obviously. Then the sliders could have been much better with
a small increase in the height of the box. A small increase in width could have
allowed space for direct control of many more parameters. And an arpeggiator!
Not to mention full width keys or more mini keys. A normal pitch bend and mod
stick would also be great, but this might make the unit deeper.</p>

<p>Dimensions multiply, and the unit would quickly become much bigger and less
cute. But it would also be much better and less toy-like. The tiny Boutique
format just seems to go better with machines with fewer controls the Juno-106
or the VP-330.</p>

<p>Seeing newer Boutique releases having features that the JP-08 should have had
also feels like betrayal, after throwing money at a first generation Boutique
model. We&rsquo;re talking tempo synced LFO, tempo synced delay, sequencer note
slides, sequencer song mode, and sequencer <em>parameter locks</em>! It hurts, Roland.</p>
