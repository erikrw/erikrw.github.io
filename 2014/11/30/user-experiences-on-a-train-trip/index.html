<div class="entry-content"><p>This week I travelled from Enschede in the Netherlands to Saarbrücken in
Germany for a research meeting. On the way I made some observations of
usability and user experience in the trains and on the train stations.
First we&rsquo;ll see some examples of bad design, then some good ones!</p>

<!-- more -->


<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/hengelo_wachtruimte.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>First, a usability classic: Door handles. The waiting rooms at the Hengelo
train station had door handles with both horizontal and vertical bars on both
sides of the door. With this abundance of handles, I somehow assumed the door
would open both in and out. I was wrong, and there was no indication of which
way it really openend. Most people will probably just try something random and
be right about 50% of the time.</p>

<p>This might seem like complaining over an insignificant problem, but the point
is simply to demonstrate principles of building products that people like,
whether it&rsquo;s a door or an iPhone. One part of doing this is to make simple
operations (such as opening a door) self-explanatory by design, and not make
the user feel stupid &mdash; such as when you open a door the wrong way.</p>

<p>Next up was my ticket, which was a print-at-home e-ticket. My Dutch is not so
good, but the ticket had a nice illustrated instruction of how I was supposed
to scan the ticket at the station:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/ns_e-ticket.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>Only there was no scanner in sight on the station. I had plenty of time, so
I went to the ticket office to ask what to do. There I learned that this
station had no scanners, so I should just board the train without scanning. And
this is probably what many people would do. But I didn&rsquo;t want
a misunderstanding to cost me a fine on the train, so I asked. And I was not
the first one to worry about it because they had put a piece of paper on the
ticket stall window saying the same thing: At this station it is not necessary
to scan the e-tickets. I recommended them to put that sign on the platforms
where people actually look for the scanners and therefore need the information.</p>

<p>On the train they had a nice info screen. But here I got momentarily confused
as well. This was a bit of Dutch I could understand: &ldquo;Aankomsttijd eindpunt&rdquo;:
Arrival time at the final destination.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/syntus_train.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>The only problem was that this final arrival time, 7:17, was <em>now</em>. I had
entered a train that was already at its destination and not going further. And
thereby possibly missed the correct train. Panic! Well, I soon found my
misunderstanding: 7:17 was indeed the current time because it was a clock, and
the real final arrival time was 7:53.</p>

<p>Besides, why would there be more stops on the list if we were already at the
final station? But the point here is not that logical thinking can lead me to
the correct interpretation of the information (which is indeed what happened).
The point is that before I had read enough from the screen to draw the right
conclusion, I had already been startled.
The problem comes from our perception that things that are close together
belong together. After reading &ldquo;Aankomsttijd eindpunt&rdquo;, my eyes were simply
drawn to left because the clock was both closer and bigger than the correct
arrival time.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/ns_speaking_zone.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>Only 20 minutes passed and I already misunderstood three things. How stupid
I must be! Well, it&rsquo;s easy to blame yourself for these things, when in fact the
design is to blame. Think about that next time you feel stupid because of your
microwave oven.</p>

<p>After I switched trains, I found something nice. Instead of just marking the
silent zone of the train as such, the normal zone was also marked as a speaking
zone. It&rsquo;s nice to not only have negative signs with bans, but also positive
signs. Who knows, it might even inspire someone to talk to a stranger!</p>

<p>Next up was Arnhem train station. Newly renovated and a good example that
a pleasant environment can give you a better experience than a functionally
equivalent but ugly environment. Arnhem station was both spacious and elegant
(and functional):</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/arnhem.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>Another aspect of train usability is door opening buttons.
On the return trip I found two types.
The left is from the inside of a Dutch train; the right is from the outside of
a German ICE train:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/train_door_buttons.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>Train doors cannot be opened by passengers while the train is in motion, so the
buttons are only active at stations. The left set of buttons leaves the user to
guess when they become enabled, while the right set lights up when active, thus
displaying their state to the user, including which button is relevant to press
(&lsquo;close&rsquo; when the door is open and vice versa).</p>

<p>Finally, tables. In <a href="/2014/11/21/the-design-of-everyday-things/">my previous post</a> I explain how the of table locks
in the Danish IC3 trains suck. The Dutch and German ones are better. Dutch on
the left, German ICE on the right:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/tray_tables.jpg" title="TODO" alt="TODO"></p>

<p>This time I&rsquo;ll give the first price to the Dutch train. The table has no lock;
friction holds the table in place. The edge can be grabbed by either hand, and
it is self-explanatory. It can also be folded back up with one hand. The ICE
train table is also easy to <em>understand</em> how to use, but physically sliding the
lock is slightly awkward. In addition it requires two hands to close; one
holding the table, and one operating the lock. (Alternatively, you can slam it
shut and make a loud noise!)</p>

<p>Thanks for reading.</p>
