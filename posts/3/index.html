  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first lesson of the official <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_%28text_editor%29">Vim</a> tutorial (&ldquo;vimtutor&rdquo;) introduces
the navigation keys <em>h</em>, <em>j</em>, <em>k</em>, <em>l</em>. This is where the user might go
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;, followed perhaps by &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with the arrow keys?&rdquo; The tutorial
has this answer: &ldquo;The cursor keys should also work. But using hjkl you will be
able to move around much faster, once you get used to it. Really!&rdquo;</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/vimtutor.png"></p>

<p>From here, I think most people continue using Vim with the arrow keys and
perhaps mouse because that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re used to, and why change something
that works? Users who actually use hjkl from this point onwards (either by
sheer willpower or by disabling the mouse and arrow keys) are learning Vim &ldquo;the
hard way&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Let me say from the beginning that I agree with the tutorial: Using hjkl <em>is</em>
better. But for most people the hard way is not the right way. Learning Vim
<a href="http://yannesposito.com/Scratch/en/blog/Learn-Vim-Progressively/">progressively</a> is more fun and will allow you to switch to Vim
while still <a href="http://yehudakatz.com/2010/07/29/everyone-who-tried-to-convince-me-to-use-vim-was-wrong/">getting work done</a>. In addition to the official
vimtutor, you can also try an <a href="http://www.openvim.com/tutorial.html">interactive tutorial</a>, or even an
<a href="http://vim-adventures.com/">adventure game</a>.</p>

<p>If, however, you are going for the hard way, let me propose learning Vim the
<em>harder</em> way!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last fall, I had been at Aalborg University for nine years: One year in
electronic engineering, five years studying software engineering, and three
years doing a PhD in computer science. The first six years as a bachelor and
master&rsquo;s student were relatively straightforward and satisfying. The last three
years formed my introduction to the academic world.</p>

<p>Being a PhD student in computer science does not mean you are a student of
computer science at a high level. Well, you are that, but first and foremost,
you are an apprentice of academia. The distinction is important because, while
I love computer science, academia is, it turned out for me, not great.</p>

<p>I left the university before having finished my PhD, to work at a private
company as an IT consultant. I managed to finish my thesis concurrently with my
new job, and I have now defended it successfully. But the last half year has
also helped me see more clearly my motivation for switching jobs. It can be
summed up like this: Now, I go home from work most days feeling a sense of
accomplishment. Before, I came home from work many days with the feeling of
having failed.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a young Windows user, I learned that if you write <code>.LOG</code> as the first line
of a text file, then each time you open it in Notepad, it appends the current
time and date to the file. That was pretty cool. And useful for logging things,
as <code>.LOG</code> implies. Later I became a <a href="http://www.vim.org/about.php">Vim</a> user and started enjoying all
the customization I can do to my editor. Or perhaps I became a Vim user because
I enjoy customizing! Either way, I like my date and time shortcuts in Vim. For
example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="n">noremap</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">expr</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">,</span><span class="n">t</span> <span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%H:%M&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This means: Map the key sequence <code>,t</code> (comma followed by &rsquo;t&#8217;) to the result of
the expression <code>strftime("%H:%M")</code> in the insert and command line modes. So if
I write &ldquo;The package arrived ,t&rdquo;, what I will see is &ldquo;The package arrived
13:43&rdquo;, or whatever the time was. I use capital T for further precision
(seconds), <code>,d</code> to insert the date (of course in ISO 8601 format), and <code>,l</code> to
insert date and time together (&lsquo;l&rsquo; for log, as with <code>.LOG</code>):</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='C'><span class='line'><span class="n">noremap</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">expr</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">,</span><span class="n">T</span> <span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%H:%M:%S&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="n">noremap</span><span class="o">!</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">expr</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="p">,</span><span class="n">d</span> <span class="n">strftime</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/rdp.png" width="450"></p>

<p>At work, I often connect to Windows servers over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
A few times, I have been met with a blank white screen, typically after
changing screen resolution in the Remote Desktop Connection options.</p>

<p>The first time this happened I spent a lot of time googling to no avail, so now
I will put the solution I found by chance here in case it might help someone
else. And note that encountering a blank <em>black</em> screen is a different and more
frequent problem, the solutions to which didn&rsquo;t help me with my white screen in
the time that I spent on it.</p>

<a name="Solution:.Alt-F4"></a>
<h3>Solution: Alt-F4</h3>

<p>An <strong>Alt-F4</strong> was all it took to get rid of the white screen. However, if that
does not work, you can also try a <strong>Ctrl-Alt-End</strong> (the remote desktop
equivalent of Ctrl-Alt-Del), and see if you can work anything out from there.
Good luck!</p>

<p>If you are already starting to forget about your New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, here&rsquo;s
a tip to keep going: Visualize your progress: Put X&rsquo;s on a calendar on every
day you do what whatever you want to do more of. Stick the calendar on the wall
or wherever it would remind you of your goal.</p>

<p>Some years back, each time I visited my dentist, she recommended that I floss.
And I would decide that <em>this time</em> I would start doing it. But some days
later, I started slipping and forgetting about it. It wasn&rsquo;t until I put
a year-at-a-glance calendar on the bathroom cabinet door that the habit stuck.</p>

<p>Putting a mark on a calendar is not rocket science, but the satisfaction of
marking a completed task and of seeing your progress is a mental reward that
can make a big difference. If you want to try, I made a one page 2016 calendar
you can print (<a href="/files/cal2016.odt">LibreOffice/odt</a>,
<a href="/files/cal2016.docx">Word/docx</a>). (It was easily made with the open source
ncal utility, invoked as <code>ncal -bh 2016</code>.)</p>

<p>The year was 2002 and I had started gymnasium (≈high school). My parents had
bought me the graphic calculator required for our maths classes: Casio fx-9750G
PLUS. It was white and green and curvy and Casio &mdash; not dark and rectangular
and from Texas Instruments, as a calculator was expected to be. Soon, however,
this happy-looking thing became my companion on my journey into the world of
programming.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django web framework</a> has a management
command to <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/checks/">check</a> your code for various problems. For
example, it checks that your database <code>CharFields</code> define the <code>max_length</code>
attribute, and that you have not set <code>DEBUG = True</code> in deployment. This is good
for catching various mistakes in using the framework before the problem shows
up in production. And for your own business logic, you have unit tests. But
there are still many things to not mess up, and they are easy to forget if they
are not incredibly easy to check. So I wrote a script to check every problem
I could think of in one go.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Lithuanian is a very old language with connections to Latin, Ancient Greek and
Sanskrit. This quote is <a href="http://termcoord.eu/2014/08/ever-wanted-travel-back-time-talk-lithuanian-3/">attributed</a> to French linguist Antoine
Meillet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anyone wishing to hear how Indo-Europeans spoke should come and listen to
a Lithuanian peasant.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/lt-flag.jpg' width='512' height='365' alt='[Lithuanian Embassy Flag] [flickr_flag] by [Mr.TinDC] [flickr_mr] is licensed under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)'><span class='caption-text'><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/3415891618/">Lithuanian Embassy Flag</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/">Mr.TinDC</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a></span></span></p>

<p>This is in itself very interesting, also because Lithuanian is less well-known,
and has survived bans and attempts of being eradicated in the past. I also have
a personal connection to the language because it is the native language of
<a href="http://www.bachata-geek.me/about-me/">my girlfriend</a> and her family. I am trying to learn it, and while I (slowly)
do so, two things stand out to me:</p>

<p>The first is that in Lithuanian, when you read a word, you know (almost) how to
pronounce it. This is very different from for example English and Danish, where
the connection between writing and pronunciation is complicated and fraught
with exceptions. See for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti">ghoti</a>, pronounced &ldquo;fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The second is that Lithuanian uses seven <em>cases</em>, which means a word has seven
different forms depending on its role in a sentence. A remnant of a case system
is seen in personal pronouns in English: <em>I helped her, and she helped me.</em> &ldquo;I&rdquo;
and &ldquo;me&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;, have the same &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;, but a different
form depending on roles such as subject and object. In Lithuanian, every noun
and adjective changes depending on role. And these roles include cool things
like being a location or an instrument or means of doing something!</p>
