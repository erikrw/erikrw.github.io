<p>R is a common letter in many languages, but it represents vastly different
sounds. Sometimes even within the same language.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant">Wikipedia says</a>:
<em>Being &ldquo;R-like&rdquo; is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically</em>.
In fact, we might not even consider the R-sound used in, say, Spain, related to
the R-sound used in France/Germany/Denmark, if they were not spelled the same.
However, it was the will of history that they are, and in this post, I will
present the three main families of R-sounds in European languages: English,
Spanish, and French.</p>

<p>I am trying to keep it jargon free; hence the names above. They are
a simplification, and in fact many languages use the three types. For example,
the &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; type is also Italian, Finnish, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Polish,
Czech, etc. Some languages, such as <a href="http://youtu.be/iIWmTglqUzY">Dutch</a> and Portuguese also use
more than one type, even within a single dialect. In this post I will cover the
three &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; R families plus a lot of other interesting R-facts,
including that R is sometimes a vowel!</p>

<p></p>

<p>(R is incidentally also a very nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">statistics program</a>, but that is
not the topic of this post!)</p>

<a name="English"></a>
<h2>English</h2>

<p>Since you are reading this in English, I think you are familiar with this type
of R:</p>

</small>
</span></p>

<p>Consonants do not usually stand alone, so what you hear is the R mixed with
vowels: [ra ara].</p>

<p>There is some variation in where the English type R is used.
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">non-rhotic</a> dialects, Rs that are not immediately followed by
a vowel disappear. A famous example is the sentence &ldquo;Park the car in Harvard
Yard&rdquo;. In a non-rhotic dialect, in Boston for example, it would be pronounced
&ldquo;Pahk the car in Hahvahd Yahd&rdquo;.
Dialects with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_and_intrusive_R#Intrusive_R">intrusive R</a> on the other hand
insert them where they didn&rsquo;t appear originally: &ldquo;I saw a film&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;I sawr
a film&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Q9D4dcYng#t=72">oh boy</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Spanish"></a>
<h2>Spanish</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; R covers two types, depending on whether you tap the tongue
<em>once</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge">behind your upper front teeth</a> or roll it multiple
times:</p>

<p>Some languages use only one of these two. In (standard) Spanish, they are both
used: For single R (as in &ldquo;pero&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;but&rdquo;) and double R (&ldquo;perro&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;),
respectively. (However, I once met a <em>Carmen</em> who told me she liked her name
pronounced with a roll consisting of three taps.)</p>

<p>This type of R is also where &ldquo;R-ness&rdquo; becomes strange: The single tap has
a D-like quality to it. For example, the <em>tt</em> in &ldquo;better&rdquo; in English is also
made by tapping the tongue on the gum ridge behind the front teeth!</p>

<p>French R, German R, Danish R. Also known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttural_R">guttural (throaty) R</a>.
Like the Spanish R, it can also be done with or without a trill:</p>

<p>These sounds are produced while touching the back of the tongue to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_uvula">uvula</a>
&mdash; the dangly thing at the back of the throat. (Danes are in fact lazy and
only <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant_consonant">approach</a></em> the back of the tongue to the uvula, but the
sound is almost the same.)</p>

<p>In the southern parts of Norway and Sweden, close to Denmark, this type of R is
also used.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Portuguese"></a>
<h2>Portuguese</h2>

<p>I have not included Portuguese as a type of R, because this beautiful language
in fact uses a large array of sounds to pronounce the letter R, depending on
dialect and context. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language#Consonants">Wikipedia says</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The actual uvular pronunciation [χ ʁ ʀ] is common in Portugal, although the
older trill [r] is also heard. In Brazil, the total inventory of /ʁ/
allophones is rather long, or up to [r ç x ɣ χ ʁ ʀ ħ h ɦ]</p></blockquote>

<p>The pronunciation of an R at the beginning of a word in Brazil can be
especially counter-intuitive (at least if you&rsquo;re not from Brazil!). As
I learned from my Portuguese teacher (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>), the word
<em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/real#Portuguese">real</a></em> (meaning both real and royal, and being the Brazilian
currency), is pronounced <em><a href="http://www.forvo.com/word/real/#pt">heau</a></em>(!) An initial R is a breathy
H-sound, and a final L is a U-like sound.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="R.as.Vowel"></a>
<h2>R as Vowel</h2>

<p>In the section on the English R, I mentioned non-rhotic dialects (typical of
England) where Rs that are not immediately followed by a vowel disappear. But
it might be more correct to say that they are vowels. Sometimes they prolong
existing vowels, as in &ldquo;park the car&rdquo;, where the R prolongs the existing
A-sound: &ldquo;paak the caa&rdquo;. Other times, you can hear the R as a separate A-like
sound: beer [bia], your [yua/yoa], poor [pua/poa]. It also merges with E:
reader [reeda], bother [botha]. Technically, the sound is a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa">schwa</a></em>, a &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, neutral vowel made while relaxing the mouth.
I guess whoever invented the word &ldquo;gangsta&rdquo; also spoke a non-rhotic dialect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I think this phenomenon is especially interesting because everybody knows that
R is a consonant, but in practice non-rhotic speakers pronounce something like
half of all Rs as a vowel!</p>

<p>The phenomenon is also part of Danish. For example, in &ldquo;stor&rdquo; [stoa], meaning
&ldquo;big&rdquo;, or &ldquo;biler&rdquo; [bila], meaning &ldquo;cars&rdquo;. The length of this vowel even
distinguishes meanings: svar [svaa], svare [svaaa], svarer [svaaaa], svarere
[svaaaaa]. These four words mean &ldquo;(an) answer&rdquo;, &ldquo;(to) answer&rdquo;, &ldquo;(an) answerer&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;(some) answerers&rdquo;. Even natives have trouble distinguishing these&hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Lojban"></a>
<h2>Lojban</h2>

<p>I will round off with the constructed language <a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> because it has
an interesting approach to the letter R.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the constructed language Esperanto. Unlike Lojban, the
older, and relatively successful Esperanto is Eurocentric (and uses the Spanish
type R). Lojban is made to make sense in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldlang">the whole world</a>. Its
vocabulary is based on the most spoken languages worldwide: Mandarin, English,
Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. Its inventory of sounds is also sparse,
which means that (small) variations in pronunciation of letters between
cultures do not disturb the meaning. Especially for R, any of the rhotic
(R-like) consonant sounds are allowed, so you can just choose the one that is
already in your native language, or the one that is the easiest to learn!</p>

<p>Its grammar is also fascinating. For example, it can use any
subject-verb-object order: SVO, SOV, OVS, OSV, VSO, VOS. It also has a complete
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">BNF</a>! (For those who know what that is.) But I will save that for some
other time!</p>
