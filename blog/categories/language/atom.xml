<p>E is the most common letter in many European languages. In English it makes up
12&ndash;13% of all letters written depending on source (see for example
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency">Wikipedia</a> or
<a href="http://practicalcryptography.com/cryptanalysis/letter-frequencies-various-languages/">Practical Cryptography</a>). The second place is T with
around 9%. In Dutch, Danish, and German, &lsquo;E&rsquo; goes as high as 15&ndash;17%. But
should it really be this common?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>That is a perhaps a difficult question to answer. Another question is: Is
E always E? And here, the answer is a clear no, at least if we think of writing
primarily as a representation of the spoken language. I will look at the sound
of E in the two languages I know the best: Danish and English.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="English"></a>
<h2>English</h2>

<p>In English, the two most well-known versions are the short and long Es:</p>

<ul>
<li>h<strong>e</strong>llo, <strong>e</strong>legant &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">ɛ</a> &mdash; Short e</li>
<li><strong>e</strong>vil, h<strong>e</strong>, sc<strong>e</strong>ne &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel">i:</a> &mdash; Long e</li>
</ul>


<p>These are however not the most <em>common</em> realizations of E. Those are instead
the following two, even though you probably don&rsquo;t give them much thought:</p>

<ul>
<li>en<strong>e</strong>my, elev<strong>e</strong>n &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa">Schwa</a>, a short, &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;
vowel made while relaxing the mouth. In many accents, the first e of
<strong>e</strong>leven is also a schwa.</li>
<li>slat<strong>e</strong>, grip<strong>e</strong>, don<strong>e</strong> &mdash; Silent!</li>
</ul>


<p>The schwa is the most common vowel sound in English, and every vowel can be
pronounced that way if unstressed (<strong>a</strong>bout, penc<strong>i</strong>l, el<strong>o</strong>quent,
s<strong>u</strong>pply, vin<strong>y</strong>l).
The silent E is also called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_e">magic E</a> if its presence in spelling
modifies the pronunciation of other vowels. Compare for example <em>slat</em> and
<em>slate</em>, <em>grip</em> and <em>gripe</em>. On the other hand, the e in <em>done</em> is truly
silent; <em>don</em> and <em>done</em> are pronounced the same.
But here are still more ways to pronounce E:</p>

<ul>
<li>d<strong>e</strong>ter, d<strong>e</strong>test &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a> &mdash; Same as th<strong>i</strong>ng</li>
<li><strong>e</strong>nvelope &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">ɛ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_rounded_vowel">ɒ</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel">ɑ</a> &mdash; (&ldquo;en-&rdquo;, &ldquo;on-&rdquo;, &ldquo;arn-&rdquo;)</li>
</ul>


<p>&ldquo;Envelope&rdquo; comes from French, but none of the three English pronunciations of
its E match the French nasal <em>en</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_vowel">ɑ̃</a>. They do however appear in other
English words such as <strong>e</strong>nd and the UK and US versions of
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/swan#Pronunciation">sw<strong>a</strong>n</a>, respectively. From French we also have</p>

<ul>
<li>resum<strong>e</strong>, fianc<strong>e</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a> &mdash; Also written é</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong">diphthong</a>, or glide between two vowels, rather than
a pure vowel. It is again different from French, where é is simply pronounced
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e</a>. But the eɪ diphthong also appears in for example the English
pronunciation of Santa Fe from Spanish, and original English words such as
l<strong>a</strong>ne. (Though I always see this diphthong transcribed /eɪ/, I think many
dialects pronounce it [ɛɪ], i.e., with the sound <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">ɛ</a> from b<strong>e</strong>d, and
f<strong>a</strong>ce (which is, ironically, transcribed /feɪs/ on <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/face#Pronunciation">Wiktionary</a>).)</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are also letter sequences that have special sounds:</p>

<ul>
<li>read<strong>er</strong>, play<strong>er</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a> (typical UK) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-colored_vowel">ɝ</a> (typical US)</li>
<li>t<strong>er</strong>m, G<strong>er</strong>man &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_central_unrounded_vowel">ɜ</a> (typical UK) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-colored_vowel">ɝ</a> (typical US)</li>
<li>Fr<strong>eu</strong>dian &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_back_rounded_vowel">ɔ</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a></li>
<li>f<strong>eu</strong>d, c<strong>ue</strong>, n<strong>ew</strong>, <strong>eu</strong>phemism &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant">j</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel">u:</a> &mdash; Here,
E only represents a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semivowel">semivowel</a>, or glide.</li>
</ul>


<p>I <a href="/2015/02/21/the-sound-of-r/">wrote about R</a> previously, and how it can influence vowels, which is
what happens in the two first cases above. I always see suffix <em>-er</em>
transcribed as schwa (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a>) for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">non-rhotic</a> accents (typical
of the UK), but I suspect some accents pronounce it with a slightly more
A-like&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-open_central_vowel">ɐ</a>, from where we get slang spellings such as <em>playa</em> and
<em>gangsta</em>.</p>

<p>So far we have eight pure vowel sounds (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">ɛ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel">i</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_rounded_vowel">ɒ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel">ɑ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_central_unrounded_vowel">ɜ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R-colored_vowel">ɝ</a>) and three diphthongs
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_back_rounded_vowel">ɔ</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-close_near-front_unrounded_vowel">ɪ</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant">j</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_back_rounded_vowel">u</a>). I have not included E&rsquo;s
function in the words <em>awe</em> and <em>eau</em> (as in <em>eau de toilette</em>), and
<em>rheumatism</em>, because it could be argued that it is silent. Especially, <em>au</em>
(as in <em>coq au vin</em>), is also pronounced [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel">o</a>] (at least in French).
The Danish inventory is similarly large:</p>

<a name="Danish"></a>
<h2>Danish</h2>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>d<strong>e</strong>n &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">ɛ</a> &mdash; h<strong>e</strong>llo</li>
<li>d<strong>e</strong>t &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e</a> &mdash; Close to r<strong>e</strong>port</li>
<li>d<strong>e</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_front_unrounded_vowel">i</a> &mdash; Like h<strong>e</strong>, but short: happ<strong>y</strong></li>
<li>s<strong>e</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_unrounded_vowel">e</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%B8d">ˀ</a> &mdash; With <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%B8d"><em>stød</em></a>; Like the e of
fianc<strong>e</strong> said very quickly</li>
<li>j<strong>e</strong>g &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_back_unrounded_vowel">ɑ</a> &mdash; f<strong>a</strong>ther. Actually part of the diphthong [ɑj], but
can be pronounced alone here.</li>
<li>spis<strong>e</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_central_vowel">ə</a> in emphatic speech &mdash; en<strong>e</strong>my</li>
<li>spis<strong>e</strong> &mdash; Silent in normal speech (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syllabic_consonant#Germanic_languages">assimilated schwa</a>)</li>
<li>spis<strong>er</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-open_central_vowel">ɐ</a> &mdash; e and r merge. Close to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">non-rhotic</a>
both<strong>er</strong>, but distinct from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa">schwa</a>.</li>
<li><strong>e</strong>r &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near-open_front_unrounded_vowel">æ</a> &mdash; Influence from R, but not merged with it. Tr<strong>a</strong>p.</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>With the above words being first two genders of <em>it</em>/<em>that</em>/<em>the</em>, then <em>they</em>,
<em>see</em>, <em>I</em>, 2x <em>eat</em>, <em>eats</em>, and <em>is</em>, these realizations of E are all part of
the core of the language and not due to any loanword; not any recent ones at
least. If we add those, we get for example:</p>

<ul>
<li>r<strong>eu</strong>matisme &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_back_unrounded_vowel">ʌ</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatal_approximant">j</a> &mdash; Close to t<strong>oy</strong></li>
<li>voy<strong>eu</strong>r &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-mid_front_rounded_vowel">œ</a> &mdash; (New Zealand b<strong>ir</strong>d)</li>
<li>mili<strong>eu</strong> &mdash; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_front_rounded_vowel">ø</a> &mdash; (South African b<strong>ir</strong>d)</li>
</ul>


<p>The last one is cheating a bit because it is no longer an accepted spelling in
Danish, where we instead use the logical &ldquo;miljø&rdquo;. But this decision is rather
arbitrary. For example, 30 years ago, the Danish language board tried to
change, among other things, the spelling of <em>mayonnaise</em> to the more logical
<em>majonæse</em>. And <a href="http://sproget.dk/raad-og-regler/artikler-mv/sproget-jyllands-postens-sprogklumme/majonesekrigen-25-ar-efter">people hated it</a> (link in Danish), even though
French words like <em>liqueur</em>, <em>portrait</em>, and <em>capitaine</em> were already spelled
<em>likør</em>, <em>portræt</em>, and <em>kaptajn</em> at the time!</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<a name="The.Sound.of.E"></a>
<h2>The Sound of E</h2>

<p>I have found the sounds above by looking at and pronouncing many words, and
also by looking through lists of vowel sounds, and looking for English and
Danish words with those sounds. Though somewhat systematic, I may have missed
some sounds of E. But what is interesting is that my list alone spans most of
our vowel capabilities! It goes from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_vowel">high</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_vowel">front</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_vowel">low</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_vowel">back</a>. An
example of the first is f<strong>ee</strong>t/d<strong>e</strong> [i], with the tongue high in the mouth
and the sound made near the front. The other end is f<strong>a</strong>ther/j<strong>e</strong>g [ɑ] with
the tongue low in the mouth and the sound made at the back.</p>

<p>I have illustrated this above. Purple vowels are common to English and Danish,
blue vowels are English, and red are Danish. The blob sizes represent my rough
guess to how often these sounds are represented by the letter E, graduated in
three levels. For the common vowel sounds, e and ɑ are used more often in
Danish than in English, while i is used more in English. ɛ is used often in
both, and ə even more. For diphthongs, only the first component is shown to
keep it simple.</p>

<p></p>

<p></p>

<a name="Does.it.have.to.be.like.this."></a>
<h2>Does it have to be like this?</h2>

<p>As we can see from the picture, the letter E is perhaps so full of meaning that
it is almost meaningless. So we could ask ourselves whether it has to be like
this? Or, could have a more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonemic_orthography">regular spelling</a>, so kids
could learn to read in <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/02/how-the-english-language-is-holding-kids-back/385291/">months rather than years</a>?
This will be a future topic!</p>

<p></p>

<a name="E.on.the.Keyboard"></a>
<h2>E on the Keyboard</h2>

<p>In the meantime, E is still the most common letter in many languages. So how
easy should it be to type on a computer keyboard? Very easy, preferably.</p>

<p>The ergonomic, three-dimensional <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Maltron_Dual_Hand_keyboard_with_Malt_Key_distribution.jpg">Maltron keyboard</a> goes as far as to
put the letter E on the strongest finger: the thumb! Most other &ldquo;normal&rdquo;
layouts that improve on QWERTY put E on the home row, where you rest your hands
when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing">touch typing</a>. A good example is the Colemak keyboard
layout which I <a href="/2015/02/27/4-years-with-colemak/">wrote about recently</a>.</p>

    <updated>2015-03-27T11:21:54+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2015/03/27/learning-lithuanian</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Lithuanian is a very old language with connections to Latin, Ancient Greek and
Sanskrit. This quote is <a href="http://termcoord.eu/2014/08/ever-wanted-travel-back-time-talk-lithuanian-3/">attributed</a> to French linguist Antoine
Meillet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anyone wishing to hear how Indo-Europeans spoke should come and listen to
a Lithuanian peasant.</p></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/lt-flag.jpg' width='512' height='365' alt='<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/3415891618/">Lithuanian Embassy Flag</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/">Mr.TinDC</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a>&#8217;><span class='caption-text'><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/3415891618/">Lithuanian Embassy Flag</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/">Mr.TinDC</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a></span></span></p>

<p>This is in itself very interesting, also because Lithuanian is less well-known,
and has survived bans and attempts of being eradicated in the past. I also have
a personal connection to the language because it is the native language of
<a href="http://www.bachata-geek.me/about-me/">my girlfriend</a> and her family. I am trying to learn it, and while I (slowly)
do so, two things stand out to me:</p>

<p>The first is that in Lithuanian, when you read a word, you know (almost) how to
pronounce it. This is very different from for example English and Danish, where
the connection between writing and pronunciation is complicated and fraught
with exceptions. See for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti">ghoti</a>, pronounced &ldquo;fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The second is that Lithuanian uses seven <em>cases</em>, which means a word has seven
different forms depending on its role in a sentence. A remnant of a case system
is seen in personal pronouns in English: <em>I helped her, and she helped me.</em> &ldquo;I&rdquo;
and &ldquo;me&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;, have the same &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;, but a different
form depending on roles such as subject and object. In Lithuanian, every noun
and adjective changes depending on role. And these roles include cool things
like being a location or an instrument or means of doing something!</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Writing"></a>
<h2>Writing</h2>

<p></li>
</ul>


<p>Lithuanian is based on the Latin alphabet, but adds and removes some letters.
My favorites are the three extra consonants &mdash; Č, Š, and Ž &mdash; and their
logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>S is as in most languages: Like the &rsquo;s&#8217; in <strong>s</strong>peak in English.</li>
<li>Š is like the &lsquo;sh&rsquo; in <strong>sh</strong>are, or Engli<strong>sh</strong>.</li>
<li>Z is like a voiced S: Like &lsquo;z&rsquo; in <strong>z</strong>oo.</li>
<li>Ž, similarly, is like a voiced Š: Like the &rsquo;s&#8217; in mea<strong>s</strong>ure, the &lsquo;si&rsquo; in
vi<strong>si</strong>on, or the &lsquo;g&rsquo; in gara<strong>g</strong>e.</li>
<li>C is pronounced like &lsquo;ts&rsquo;, as in roo<strong>ts</strong>.</li>
<li>Č follows the pattern of S/Š and Z/Ž: It&rsquo;s like the &lsquo;ch&rsquo; in <strong>ch</strong>erry.</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>I think it is interesting to have separate letters for these sounds. They are
compact and more predictable than in English where for example &lsquo;ch&rsquo; can be
pronounced as in &ldquo;<strong>ch</strong>erry&rdquo; (the standard č-sound), &ldquo;stoma<strong>ch</strong>&rdquo; (k-sound),
&ldquo;ma<strong>ch</strong>ine&rdquo; (š-sound), or even &ldquo;ya<strong>ch</strong>t&rdquo; (no sound).</p>

<p>That is not to say that they are 100% predictable. Coca-Cola, for example, is
still written Coca-Cola (even though I do enjoy pronouncing it &ldquo;tsotsa-tsola&rdquo;
for fun). But some imported words do change spelling. Can you guess what &ldquo;pica&rdquo;
is? (I&rsquo;d love to have some.)</p>

<p></p>

<p>All in all, the spelling is fairly systematic, but regarding stress/accent,
it&rsquo;s no better than English or Danish. From my <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Lithuanian-Teach-Yourself-Language/dp/0071765980">Lithuanian book</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rules concerning word stress are really quite complicated in Lithuanian,
unfortunately, so it is best if you try to imitate both pronunciation and
stress [when listening].</p></blockquote>

<p>This is opposed to a language such as Spanish, where accents mark exceptions.
Most unmarked words are stressed on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable, so
for example if <em>corazón</em> was written without the accent, it should be
pronounced co<strong>ra</strong>zon rather than cora<strong>zon</strong>.</p>

<p>But perhaps technology is changing this. Whereas accents and other
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritics</a> are easy to add in handwriting, it takes
more time on computers and mobile phones, enough that they are often skipped in
casual writing, reducing the logic of the written language, in Spanish as well
as in Lithuanian. But that is all part of the evolution of languages.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="In.Any.Case"></a>
<h2>In Any Case</h2>

<p></p>

<p>In English, words&#8217; roles in sentences (subject, object, etc.) are marked with
word order and prepositions (to, in, on, etc.). But there is another way of
marking them, namely cases. Lithuanian has seven:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nominative &ndash; as subject (unmarked in English)</li>
<li>Genitive &ndash; possessive (of, &rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Dative &ndash; as indirect object (for, to)</li>
<li>Accusative &ndash; as direct object (unmarked in English)</li>
<li>Instrumental &ndash; as instrument/tool/means/company (using, with)</li>
<li>Locative &ndash; location (in)</li>
<li>Vocative &ndash; addressing someone (unmarked in English)</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>Each noun has these seven forms, for example
al<strong>us</strong> (beer),
al<strong>aus</strong> (of beer, beer&rsquo;s),
al<strong>ui</strong> (for beer),
al<strong>ų</strong> (beer as object),
al<strong>umi</strong> (with beer),
al<strong>uje</strong> (in beer),
al<strong>au</strong> (O, beer!).
And then it has another seven forms in plural.
Here follows some examples of case use that I like.</p>

<a name="Examples"></a>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The first is about Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and the locative case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vilniaus centre yra daug bažnyčių.</li>
<li>Vilnius-GEN center-LOC are many church-GEN-PLUR.</li>
<li>of-Vilnius in-center are many of-churches.</li>
<li>There are many churches in the center of Vilnius.</li>
</ul>


<p>When I first decoded this sentence I was stoked. It is such a different way of
representing information. Another example I saw in an electrician&rsquo;s advert:</p>

<ul>
<li>Šviesa jūsų projektams.</li>
<li>Light-NOM you-GEN project-DAT-PLUR.</li>
<li>Light of-you for-projects.</li>
<li>Light for your projects.</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<p>Last Christmas I got a present with a label with a single word on it: <em>Erikui</em>.
It is the dative case of my name so it means &ldquo;for Erik&rdquo;. But this does requires
a name with a special ending to fit into the declension paradigms. My
Lithuanian name is Erikas. Some possible endings are -as, -is, -us (masculine),
and -a and -ė (feminine).</p>

<p>The vocative (addressing) case is especially relevant for names. For example,
my girlfriend&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s name is Tomas. But to get someone&rsquo;s attention, you use
the vocative: Tomai. This was weird to me at first, but on the other hand, if
you hear your name spoken, you can tell whether people are talking <em>to</em> you or
<em>about</em> you, which is nifty. Here are some examples of the instrumental case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aš žaidžiu kamuoliu &#8594; I-NOM play ball-INS &#8594; I play with-ball &#8594; I play with a ball</li>
<li>Važiuoju autobusu su tavimi &#8594; (I) go bus-INS with you-INS &#8594; I go by bus with you</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see in the second example, prepositions are still used. In this case
an explicit &ldquo;with&rdquo; to say &ldquo;with you as a companion&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;with you as
a means&rdquo;. Languages with even more cases such as Finnish and Estonian express
relationships like &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case#Estonian">as cases</a>, while they
are prepositions in Lithuanian. In Lithuanian, prepositions can also be
overloaded. For example <em>po</em> + instrumental means &ldquo;under&rdquo; while <em>po</em> + genitive
means &ldquo;after&rdquo;.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Finally, a cute example of the locative:</p>

<ul>
<li>Du viename.</li>
<li>Two-NOM one-LOC.</li>
<li>Two in-one.</li>
<li>Two in one.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Learning.to.Count"></a>
<h3>Learning to Count</h3>

<p>I am fascinated with this case system, but it also takes a considerable amount
of time to build a vocabulary. One thing that is especially hard is counting.
As you have just seen, numbers can be used in the locative. But typically, the
case of the number just matches what it counts. &ldquo;Vien<strong>as</strong> tašk<strong>as</strong>,
penk<strong>i</strong> tašk<strong>ai</strong>&rdquo; means &ldquo;one point, five points&rdquo; in the nominative case.
But as an object in the sentence, it is different:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turiu vien<strong>ą</strong> tašk<strong>ą</strong> &mdash; I have one point (accusative singular)</li>
<li>Turiu penk<strong>is</strong> tašk<strong>us</strong> &mdash; I have five points (accusative plural)</li>
</ul>


<p>And on top of that, the genitive overrides for some numbers, for example those
ending in zero, while those ending in one are singular, even if the number
itself is not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turiu dešimt tašk<strong>ų</strong> &mdash; I have 10 points (genitive plural)</li>
<li>Turiu dvidešimt tašk<strong>ų</strong> &mdash; I have 20 points (genitive plural)</li>
<li>Turiu dvidešimtvien<strong>ą</strong> tašk<strong>ą</strong> &mdash; I have 21 points (accusative
<em>singular</em>)</li>
</ul>


<p>Then add to that that numbers also decline for gender, and you have not one
word meaning &ldquo;two&rdquo;, but 14 (7 cases * 2 genders). Then you can add the ordinal
(&ldquo;second&rdquo;), which in Lithuanian has 7 cases * 2 genders * 2 numbers
(singular/plural) * 2 forms (pronominal/non-pronominal) + a neuter form =
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antras#Declension">57 forms</a>.
</p>

<p>On top of the two main types of numbers &mdash; cardinal/quantitative (one, two,
etc.) and ordinal (first, second, etc.) &mdash; Lithuanian has two more. The first
is a &ldquo;super-plural&rdquo; for counting groups and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum">plurals-only</a>, which,
in English, are words like scissors, clothes and electronics. The second is
a collective type for the size of groups: Where English speakers can talk about
a pair, a dozen, a hundred, or a million of x, Lithuanians can equally easily
talk about groups of any size.</p>

<a name="The.Beauty"></a>
<h2>The Beauty</h2>

<p></p>

<p>I am told by my better half that the collective numbers are not common in
everyday use, and that probably holds for some of the other grammatical
features I come across as well. But while some people learn about the roots of
Indo-European languages from Latin or Ancient Greek, I do it from Lithuanian.
Plus I learn to speak my girlfriend&rsquo;s language at the same time. And Lithuanian
is great for creating affectionate words! As written by Élisée Reclus in
Nouvelle géographie universelle:</p>

<blockquote><p>Of all European languages, the Lithuanian has the greatest number of
affectionate and diminutive terms, more than the Spanish or Italian, even
more than Russian, and they can be multiplied almost indefinitely by adding
them to verbs and adverbs as well as adjectives and nouns. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>If the value of a nation in the total sum humanity were to be measured by the
beauty of its language, the Lithuanian ought to have the first place among
the nations of Europe.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2015/02/21/the-sound-of-r</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/voiced_uvular_fricative.png" title="&lsquo;R&rsquo; &lsquo;R&rsquo;" ></p>

<p>R is a common letter in many languages, but it represents vastly different
sounds. Sometimes even within the same language.
As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_consonant">Wikipedia says</a>:
<em>Being &ldquo;R-like&rdquo; is an elusive and ambiguous concept phonetically</em>.
In fact, we might not even consider the R-sound used in, say, Spain, related to
the R-sound used in France/Germany/Denmark, if they were not spelled the same.
However, it was the will of history that they are, and in this post, I will
present the three main families of R-sounds in European languages: English,
Spanish, and French.</p>

<p>I am trying to keep it jargon free; hence the names above. They are
a simplification, and in fact many languages use the three types. For example,
the &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; type is also Italian, Finnish, Icelandic, Lithuanian, Polish,
Czech, etc. Some languages, such as <a href="http://youtu.be/iIWmTglqUzY">Dutch</a> and Portuguese also use
more than one type, even within a single dialect. In this post I will cover the
three &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; R families plus a lot of other interesting R-facts,
including that R is sometimes a vowel!</p>

<p></p>

<p>(R is incidentally also a very nice <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_%28programming_language%29">statistics program</a>, but that is
not the topic of this post!)</p>

<h2>English</h2>

<p>Since you are reading this in English, I think you are familiar with this type
of R:</p>

<p></p>

</small>
</span></p>

<p>Consonants do not usually stand alone, so what you hear is the R mixed with
vowels: [ra ara].</p>

<p>There is some variation in where the English type R is used.
In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhotic_and_non-rhotic_accents">non-rhotic</a> dialects, Rs that are not immediately followed by
a vowel disappear. A famous example is the sentence &ldquo;Park the car in Harvard
Yard&rdquo;. In a non-rhotic dialect, in Boston for example, it would be pronounced
&ldquo;Pahk the car in Hahvahd Yahd&rdquo;.
Dialects with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linking_and_intrusive_R#Intrusive_R">intrusive R</a> on the other hand
insert them where they didn&rsquo;t appear originally: &ldquo;I saw a film&rdquo; becomes &ldquo;I sawr
a film&rdquo; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-Q9D4dcYng#t=72">oh boy</a>).</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Spanish"></a>
<h2>Spanish</h2>

<p>The &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo; R covers two types, depending on whether you tap the tongue
<em>once</em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alveolar_ridge">behind your upper front teeth</a> or roll it multiple
times:</p>

<p>Some languages use only one of these two. In (standard) Spanish, they are both
used: For single R (as in &ldquo;pero&rdquo;, meaning &ldquo;but&rdquo;) and double R (&ldquo;perro&rdquo;, &ldquo;dog&rdquo;),
respectively. (However, I once met a <em>Carmen</em> who told me she liked her name
pronounced with a roll consisting of three taps.)</p>

<p>This type of R is also where &ldquo;R-ness&rdquo; becomes strange: The single tap has
a D-like quality to it. For example, the <em>tt</em> in &ldquo;better&rdquo; in English is also
made by tapping the tongue on the gum ridge behind the front teeth!</p>

<p>French R, German R, Danish R. Also known as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guttural_R">guttural (throaty) R</a>.
Like the Spanish R, it can also be done with or without a trill:</p>

<p>These sounds are produced while touching the back of the tongue to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_uvula">uvula</a>
&mdash; the dangly thing at the back of the throat. (Danes are in fact lazy and
only <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximant_consonant">approach</a></em> the back of the tongue to the uvula, but the
sound is almost the same.)</p>

<p>In the southern parts of Norway and Sweden, close to Denmark, this type of R is
also used.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Portuguese"></a>
<h2>Portuguese</h2>

<p>I have not included Portuguese as a type of R, because this beautiful language
in fact uses a large array of sounds to pronounce the letter R, depending on
dialect and context. As <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language#Consonants">Wikipedia says</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The actual uvular pronunciation [χ ʁ ʀ] is common in Portugal, although the
older trill [r] is also heard. In Brazil, the total inventory of /ʁ/
allophones is rather long, or up to [r ç x ɣ χ ʁ ʀ ħ h ɦ]</p></blockquote>

<p>The pronunciation of an R at the beginning of a word in Brazil can be
especially counter-intuitive (at least if you&rsquo;re not from Brazil!). As
I learned from my Portuguese teacher (from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bras%C3%ADlia">Brasília</a>), the word
<em><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/real#Portuguese">real</a></em> (meaning both real and royal, and being the Brazilian
currency), is pronounced <em><a href="http://www.forvo.com/word/real/#pt">heau</a></em>(!) An initial R is a breathy
H-sound, and a final L is a U-like sound.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="R.as.Vowel"></a>
<h2>R as Vowel</h2>

<p>In the section on the English R, I mentioned non-rhotic dialects (typical of
England) where Rs that are not immediately followed by a vowel disappear. But
it might be more correct to say that they are vowels. Sometimes they prolong
existing vowels, as in &ldquo;park the car&rdquo;, where the R prolongs the existing
A-sound: &ldquo;paak the caa&rdquo;. Other times, you can hear the R as a separate A-like
sound: beer [bia], your [yua/yoa], poor [pua/poa]. It also merges with E:
reader [reeda], bother [botha]. Technically, the sound is a
<em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwa">schwa</a></em>, a &ldquo;lazy&rdquo;, neutral vowel made while relaxing the mouth.
I guess whoever invented the word &ldquo;gangsta&rdquo; also spoke a non-rhotic dialect.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I think this phenomenon is especially interesting because everybody knows that
R is a consonant, but in practice non-rhotic speakers pronounce something like
half of all Rs as a vowel!</p>

<p>The phenomenon is also part of Danish. For example, in &ldquo;stor&rdquo; [stoa], meaning
&ldquo;big&rdquo;, or &ldquo;biler&rdquo; [bila], meaning &ldquo;cars&rdquo;. The length of this vowel even
distinguishes meanings: svar [svaa], svare [svaaa], svarer [svaaaa], svarere
[svaaaaa]. These four words mean &ldquo;(an) answer&rdquo;, &ldquo;(to) answer&rdquo;, &ldquo;(an) answerer&rdquo;,
and &ldquo;(some) answerers&rdquo;. Even natives have trouble distinguishing these&hellip;</p>

<p></p>

<a name="Lojban"></a>
<h2>Lojban</h2>

<p>I will round off with the constructed language <a href="http://www.lojban.org/tiki/Lojban">Lojban</a> because it has
an interesting approach to the letter R.</p>

<p>You may have heard of the constructed language Esperanto. Unlike Lojban, the
older, and relatively successful Esperanto is Eurocentric (and uses the Spanish
type R). Lojban is made to make sense in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldlang">the whole world</a>. Its
vocabulary is based on the most spoken languages worldwide: Mandarin, English,
Hindi, Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. Its inventory of sounds is also sparse,
which means that (small) variations in pronunciation of letters between
cultures do not disturb the meaning. Especially for R, any of the rhotic
(R-like) consonant sounds are allowed, so you can just choose the one that is
already in your native language, or the one that is the easiest to learn!</p>

<p>Its grammar is also fascinating. For example, it can use any
subject-verb-object order: SVO, SOV, OVS, OSV, VSO, VOS. It also has a complete
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form">BNF</a>! (For those who know what that is.) But I will save that for some
other time!</p>
