<p>I&rsquo;ve used the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds II for almost a month and the Jabra
Elite 85t earbuds for 4&ndash;5 months. Both are flagship products, with the Boses
being released a few months ago, and the Jabras two years ago. This means that
by now, the Jabras only cost around half as much as the Boses. That doesn&rsquo;t
make the Boses better at everything, however. Depending on what qualities you
value, one or the other could be the better pair.</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Noise.reduction"></a>
<h2>Noise reduction</h2>

<p>I am easily distracted by noise and sound which is why I wanted great noise
reduction, and Bose did not disappoint. The noise reduction of the QuietComfort
Earbuds II is fantastic. I think they&rsquo;re almost as good as the over-ear Bose
Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, which is an amazing feat.</p>

<p>I use the term noise reduction instead of noise cancellation, because noise
cancellation is only one component of the total noise reduction. There&rsquo;s
passive isolation (think earplugs) which the Boses do better than the Jabras,
because the Boses get a better seal in my ears. Jabra describes Elite 85t with
their oval ear tips as a semi-open design, so it&rsquo;s not so strange they have
less isolation. (Most Jabra true wireless earbuds except for the 85t&rsquo;s have
round ear tips and are described as a closed design.) It&rsquo;s a bit strange though
that the Boses get a better seal while also having an oblong shape (though more
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_(geometry)">stadium</a> than oval).</p>

<p>The next part of noise reduction is active noise cancellation (ANC). The Jabras
have good ANC, but the Boses have possibly the world&rsquo;s best. Third and finally,
I count noise masking as part of noise reduction: The use of regular wide-band
noise to drown out irregular noises. Bose does not list noise masking as a
feature of the QCE II but I do think they use it a little bit. More than other
ANC products I&rsquo;ve tried, the QCE II has a white noise-y hiss in the background
(even with occasional hints of static). I&rsquo;ve seen some people on Reddit be very
unhappy about this, but to me it&rsquo;s acceptable since the QCE IIs are so good at
reducing external distractions which is what I use them for. I don&rsquo;t know if
Bose used masking on purpose or it&rsquo;s just a consequence of their beefy ANC.
Either way, it works.</p>

<p>Winner: Bose</p>

<a name="Connectivity"></a>
<h2>Connectivity</h2>

<p>Both the Boses and the Jabras can be paired with (remember) multiple Bluetooth
sound sources, but the Boses can only be <em>connected</em> to one source at a time,
while the Jabras can be connected to two at the same time, known as multipoint.
From what I read, the first-generation QCEs could easily be switched to another
sound source by pressing the button in the charging case, but the QCE II case
button is only for pairing, not for switching between paired devices.</p>

<p>Bose has other products with multipoint such as the Noise Cancelling Headphones
700, it just seems they didn&rsquo;t find room for it in the earbuds. To switch
sources, Bose suggests using the Bose Music smartphone app, but I find it too
slow to use. Instead I use the target device&rsquo;s Bluetooth menu to &ldquo;steal&rdquo; the
connection. For example if the Boses are connected to my Android phone and I
want to use them with my work computer, I press Win+K to open the connections
menu, and select the Boses which then disconnect from my phone and connect to
the computer. But then when I walk out of the office and the Boses lose the
computer connection, they don&rsquo;t automatically connect to my phone in my pocket.</p>

<p>Both products have stable Bluetooth connections, but the Jabras just
automatically connect to the two most recent devices within range, and it Just
Works.</p>

<p>Winner: Jabra</p>

<a name="Sound.quality"></a>
<h2>Sound quality</h2>

<p>The Jabras sound good, but the Boses sound very good, with much deeper bass,
probably helped by the better seal in my ears. In fact, I&rsquo;ve had to reduce the
low end a bit in the equalizer, so now it&rsquo;s perfect.</p>

<p>Another kind of sound quality is how good phone/voice calls sound to the people
in the other end, listening to you. I have not tried being on the receiving end
of these earbuds, but my impression, based on other people&rsquo;s reviews and tests
online, is that both products are acceptable but not great for call quality.
However, from the music listening experience alone I will definitely say:</p>

<p>Winner: Bose</p>

<a name="Charging.case"></a>
<h2>Charging case</h2>

<p>Both cases feel smooth and sturdy, even though closing their lids sounds a bit
clacky. If they could have fit a soft-close feature for the lids, that would be
really nice. Either way, the Bose case is pretty large while the Jabra case is
smaller, though not small.</p>

<p>Each case has a battery status LED. Jabra indicates high, medium, and low
battery state of charge by green, (greenish) yellow, and red. Bose lumps high
and medium into one with a white light, and low battery is amber. The Jabra one
seemed more intuitive to me, though I think the Bose colors might be more
inclusive to color blind people, which is nice.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s very easy to get the buds out of the Jabra case, while it&rsquo;s easiest to use
two hands to get one bud out of the Bose case. Combined with a bit slow
connection and auto-calibration, it takes around 15 seconds from I open the
case until I can start using the Boses. With the Jabras, it takes 5 seconds as
I can take one bud in each hand, and they connect quickly. The Jabra buds snap
very satisfyingly back into the case after use, while the Boses require more
precise handling to get back in, and have a less satisfying snap. Small things,
but the Jabra case is just a joy to use.</p>

<p>Winner: Jabra</p>

<a name="Comfort"></a>
<h2>Comfort</h2>

<p>After using the Jabras for months, I was amazed the first time I put the Boses
in my ears. They felt much better than the Jabras, and the fit was more secure.
After the initial impression, and after wearing the Boses for some hours, the
difference did not feel as large, but the Boses are still a bit more
comfortable. The Boses are also more customizable in terms of fit and
stability, while the Jabras fit less securely in my ears.</p>

<p>Winner: Bose</p>

<a name="Controls"></a>
<h2>Controls</h2>

<p>The two products take different approaches: Jabra uses physical buttons while
Bose uses a touch sensitive surface that you both tap and swipe. The Jabras
don&rsquo;t have the swiping actions so you control volume by holding down the
buttons &mdash; hold right bud to increase volume and left to decrease. With Bose,
each bud has full control of volume by swiping up/down, plus more actions you
can do on either side such as one tap to ⏯, two taps to ⏭, and three taps to ⏮.</p>

<p>The Bose controls look better on paper, but the Jabras feel way better in real
life. You can use the physical buttons quickly and effortlessly and always know
if you pressed the correct number of times. All control actions have around one
second of delay before they happen which is why the physical feedback is even
more important. The touch surfaces are slower to use, require more precision
and don&rsquo;t give haptic feedback so you&rsquo;re not sure if a tap registered and
consequently if you tapped the correct number of times. And the touch surface
doesn&rsquo;t work with gloves or headgear that covers the ears. I love that I can
use the Jabras through clothing.</p>

<p>Winner: Jabra</p>

<a name="Transparency.mode"></a>
<h2>Transparency mode</h2>

<p>Transparency mode uses the earbuds&#8217; microphones to let you hear what&rsquo;s going on
around you without taking out the earbuds. Bose calls it <em>Aware</em> while Jabra
calls it <em>HearThrough</em>. Bose Aware mode provides great transparency once the
feature is turned on, but it&rsquo;s annoyingly slow to turn on because it requires a
long press, and then you have to wait for the voice prompt to tell you you&rsquo;re
in Aware mode. It&rsquo;s faster to take a bud out than to wait for the Aware mode to
turn on, so I usually just take one bud out if I need to briefly talk to
someone. Jabra HearThrough is easy and quick to turn on, with or without
gloves, with a single press of the left earbud, but the sound quality is not
especially good.</p>

<p>The Jabras have the advantage that they can work in &ldquo;old school&rdquo; mode with
neither of the newfangled ANC and HearThrough features turned on, whereas Bose
only lets you fade in a straight line between Aware (max transparency) and
Quiet (max ANC) &mdash; you can&rsquo;t turn off the smart features. Bose on the other
hand has a potential advantage with its ActiveSense feature which tries to be
transparent while also cancelling/reducing loud noises in your surroundings.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a draw.</p>

<a name="Mono.mode"></a>
<h2>Mono mode</h2>

<p>Mono mode means using one earbud alone. Both products have the right earbud as
the primary one, meaning that the left one is not designed to be used alone. An
advantage of the Bose touch surface controls is that using only one bud gives
you almost all controls on that one bud. The only choice you have to make is
whether long press triggers mode switch or voice assistant, as you cannot have
both on the same bud. The left Bose bud can actually be used alone for playing
audio (no calls) as long as the right bud is turned on, i.e., not in the case,
to relay the audio data from your phone/computer.</p>

<p>For Jabra, the single/double/triple press of each bud can be assigned to
different actions except for volume control. Even though long pressing the
right bud normally increases volume, this is disabled in mono mode, probably so
you don&rsquo;t set the volume too high using the right bud and then can&rsquo;t get it
back down because you&rsquo;re not wearing the left bud which has the volume down
button. You can however use the right bud to activate your device&rsquo;s voice
assistant and ask them to change the volume. The physical button with its
limits again has the upside that it works through fabric. Finally, the right
Jabra bud actually fits pretty well in the left ear, and I do use it like that
occasionally.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a draw.</p>

<a name="Battery.life..Water.resistance"></a>
<h2>Battery life, Water resistance</h2>

<p>Bose claims &ldquo;up to&rdquo; 6 hours on a single charge and 24 hours in total including
the charging case. Jabra claims &ldquo;up to&rdquo; 5.5 hours on a single charge and 25
hours including the case. I have not tried to confirm the numbers, but both
products are totally adequate. In practice I charge the Jabra case more often,
but I think that&rsquo;s because its battery indicator shows a non-full battery after
using only (my guess) one third of the charge whereas the Bose case shows
normal status until you have used two thirds of the charge.</p>

<p>As for water resistance, both products are rated IPX4 (splash proof), but I&rsquo;m
not going to test the limits of that!</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a draw.</p>

<a name="App.support..Wireless.charging"></a>
<h2>App support, Wireless charging</h2>

<p>Both products have supporting smartphone apps. When the Jabra Sound+ app
starts, it connects very quickly to the earbuds and you can use the app almost
immediately. The Bose Music app, even though my phone is already connected to
the earbuds and playing music, sometimes needs to &ldquo;find&rdquo; the earbuds when I
start the app which is frustrating to wait for.</p>

<p>Both apps contain settings, mode setup, equalizer, help/tips, etc. The Jabra
app has some extra features: It shows the case battery state, which is really
nice, and it can play soundscapes like White noise, Pink noise, Waterfall,
Ocean waves, etc.</p>

<p>The Jabra case can be charged wirelessly on a Qi charger. So could the original
QCE case, but not the QCE II case. Not important to me, though it definitely is
to some people.</p>

<p>Winner: Jabra</p>

<p><br> The two products win approximately the same number of categories, but some
categories are more important than others. To me, noise reduction is paramount,
which is why I prefer Bose overall, but it&rsquo;s no landslide victory. While I
enjoy the ANC when working at the office, I also dislike having to switch
Bluetooth sound sources manually, often multiple times per day.</p>

<p>Going outside in the winter, I definitely prefer the Jabras, with their
physical buttons that I can use unhindered by winter getup. In hindsight, I
should not have bought the Jabra Elite 85t&rsquo;s with their semi-open design, as
they let in too much external sound for my taste. I might have preferred their
newer Elite 5 or 7 models.</p>

<p>The best product would be a lovechild of Bose and Jabra with the fit, ANC, and
sound quality from Bose and everything else from Jabra. That would be hard to
beat (except perhaps on call quality).</p>

    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2022/06/04/aawireless-first-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/aawireless.jpg" width="375" title="Picture shows a car infotainment screen with Google Maps as well as the small AAWireless device plugged in to the car&rsquo;s USB port" ></p>

<p>My <a href="/2021/05/02/hyundai-ioniq-electric/">car</a> supports Android Auto which lets me connect my smartphone and
use the phone&rsquo;s apps on the car&rsquo;s infotainment system including touchscreen,
speakers and microphone. Examples include Google Maps for navigation and
Spotify for music, as well as Google Assistant voice commands.</p>

<p>It normally requires a wired USB connection between phone and car, but
<a href="https://www.aawireless.io/">AAWireless</a> is a device that acts as a wireless bridge between
phone and car while the device stays plugged in to the car, so your phone can
stay in your pocket or bag. I&rsquo;m happy so say it works well so far.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>With the product being crowdfunded, and just being a consumer electronic
product in general, I was prepared for some problems. To my pleasant surprise,
the product Just Works for me. After the initial Bluetooth pairing, the device
connects quickly when I turn the car on, and the car&rsquo;s touchscreen is
responsive. I did not use the accompanying <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.aawireless">app</a> to configure or update
the device, as it was not necessary for me, and because I didn&rsquo;t want the app
to update the device&rsquo;s firmware, as some reviews complained about problems with
a recent version of the firmware.</p>

<p>The AAWireless device uses less than 1&nbsp;W of power from the wired USB
connection which is nice. I don&rsquo;t know how the phone&rsquo;s power consumption is
affected and I have not yet tried longer trips with the AAWireless. But based
on my limited experience with it, I&rsquo;m happy with the purchase.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erw.dk/2018/04/14/my-weird-keyboard/"/>
    <updated>2018-04-14T16:57:10+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2018/04/14/my-weird-keyboard</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a weird computer keyboard: The <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage</a>.
It&rsquo;s a concave, columnar, split, tented, mechanical keyboard with thumb keys.
It&rsquo;s very comfortable and much better than anything Logitech or Microsoft have
ever labeled ergonomic.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage2.jpg"></p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Ergonomic.Features"></a>
<h2>Ergonomic Features</h2>

<p><strong>Columnar</strong> means that the keys are laid out in straight columns, so you don&rsquo;t
have to bend your fingers sideways as you curl and extend them &mdash; unlike on
a standard, staggered keyboard, where especially the left hand fingers need to
move unnaturally. The <strong>split</strong> also helps avoiding sideways bends for the
wrists. For more details, see the illustration of the <a href="https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/unique-symmetric-columnar-key-arrangement--truly-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard--orthogonal-matrix-non-staggered">Truly Ergonomic
keyboard</a> (which I haven&rsquo;t tried (yet)).</p>

<p><strong>Tented</strong> means that the thumb side of each hand sits higher than the pinky
side. This gives the wrists a more natural rotation. The Advantage only tilts
20 degrees &mdash; other keyboards such as the
<a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">Kinesis Freestyle</a> and the <a href="http://safetype.com">SafeType</a> can tent
(up to) 90 degrees (while <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/frreestyle2-ascent-90-1.jpg">looking</a> even less
conventional than the Advantage).</p>

<p>The <strong>thumb key</strong> clusters make more keys reachable without moving the hand
away from its home position, and it offloads Backspace and Enter from the
overworked right pinky and onto the stronger thumbs.</p>

<p>The <strong>mechanical</strong> keyswitches (Cherry MX brown or red) register the keypress
when the key is halfway depressed (2 out of 4 millimeters). This is opposed to
standard rubber dome keyboards that require you to bottom out &mdash; fully depress
the key until the finger is jolted to a stop.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage2_side.jpg"></p>

<p>The best feature of the Advantage is the <strong>concave</strong> keywells: The scooped-out
parts of the keyboard where the alphanumeric keys reside. They serve several
purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>As you curl and extend your fingers, the keys remain at the same distance
from your fingertips, so you don&rsquo;t need to stretch your fingers much to
reach. This also makes it easy to access all five (!) rows of keys.</li>
<li>The same happens when you move your index finger to the side (like T, G, B),
reducing sideways-twisting finger motions.</li>
<li>The depths of the columns are matched with the corresponding fingers, so they
all rest naturally in the home position.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Switching"></a>
<h2>Switching</h2>

<p>I got my first Kinesis Advantage in 2011. As I recall, it only took a few days
to adapt to this weird keyboard. The best part is that I can still switch
effortlessly between the Advantage and standard, flat, staggered keyboards. Not
that I particularly enjoy it, but I can do it, which is very practical for
traveling. The Advantage is actually narrower than a standard 104/105-key
keyboard, but it&rsquo;s bigger in the two other dimensions and therefore not easy to
transport.</p>

<p>However, the physical shape of my keyboard is not the only weird thing about my
typing. The <em>logical</em> layout I use &mdash; <a href="/2015/02/27/4-years-with-colemak/">Colemak</a> &mdash; is weird too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage_custom_keycaps_right.jpg"></p>

<p>Switching logical layout is much harder for me than switching physical layout.
Even though the Advantage is firmware remappable, I set my logical layout in
the computer OS, so I will keep the logical layout for all keyboards, including
the laptop keyboard.</p>

<p>Some people retain their QWERTY touch typing skills while learning an
alternative layout by associating logical layout with physical keyboard, e.g.,
typing Colemak on the Advantage and QWERTY on standard keyboards. And I did
actually get the Advantage the same year I switched to Colemak, but I much
prefer typing Colemak on my laptop while traveling over maintaining my QWERTY
skills.</p>

<a name="Legends"></a>
<h2>Legends</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really necessary have Colemak legends on the keys, but I did get a set
of custom keycaps made by <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD keyboards</a> for one of my two Advantages
&mdash; complete with my Danish variation of Colemak &mdash; as shown in the images
above and below. It&rsquo;s mostly for show, because the legends are not necessary
for touch typing, and the Advantage is not so good anyway for one-handed use
where the legends might be relevant.</p>

<p>In fact, hunt-and-peck typing is for some reason easier for me with QWERTY
legends, even while I type Colemak. My eyes are more used to the common QWERTY
layout, I guess. I just know that pressing the QWERTY &rsquo;T&#8217; key produces a &lsquo;G&rsquo; in
Colemak. If I look down and the key shows a &lsquo;G&rsquo;, my eyes get confused, even
though my fingers knows exactly where to press to get the &lsquo;G&rsquo; while touch
typing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage_custom_keycaps_left.jpg"></p>

<a name="Downsides"></a>
<h2>Downsides</h2>

<p>The Advantage is not great for everything. Split keyboards are not good for the
occasional one-handed use (e.g., while holding a drink, phone, piece of paper).</p>

<p>The Advantage is not the best for gaming either. The arrow keys are spread on
both sides of the split which is fine for two-handed office and programming
use, but not ideal for gaming. The key positions are matched to finger lengths,
so the WASD keys will not work well with the normal WASD-fingers. ESDF should
be perfect, though.</p>

<p>For a long time, the typical complaint of the Advantage was the low quality of
the rubber F-keys. In 2016, the Advantage2 was launched, with Cherry ML
switches instead of rubber dome F-keys, and more programming options. This is
the product I link to in the top of the post because the product page for the
old version seems to be gone. I haven&rsquo;t tried it, but I can only imagine it&rsquo;s
an improvement.</p>

<p>Another problem partially solved by time is the built-in combined USB hub and
PS/2-to-USB converter. It &mdash; and the whole keyboard with it &mdash; didn&rsquo;t work
with Windows 7. Kinesis did sell a cable conversion kit to work around this,
but I went DIY and installed a PS/2-to-USB adapter myself, bypassing the
problematic USB hub, on my &ldquo;work&rdquo; board.</p>

<p>My &ldquo;home&rdquo; board always worked fine with Linux (and Windows 10), but it&rsquo;s also
not recognized by the BIOS of my desktop computer&rsquo;s motherboard. A smaller
problem but I&rsquo;m considering giving this board a USB hubectomy as well. The
Advantage2 has supposedly also solved this problem.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with the Advantage, but they are minor compared to the
Advantage (heh) of using an extremely comfortable keyboard for my 10+ daily
hours of computer usage.</p>

<a name="Key.Remapping"></a>
<h2>Key Remapping</h2>

<p>My remaining complaints were solved with easy firmware remapping, which is in
fact just a testament to the Advantage&rsquo;s flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>I swapped Space and Backspace because I have for some reason always used my
left hand&rsquo;s thumb for Space.</li>
<li>I use the Alt+Tab shortcut all the time, so I moved the Alt key closer to my
thumb in the left thumb cluster.</li>
<li>I made the key above Tab work as an Escape key.</li>
<li>I made the key below Tab work as a Control key because that&rsquo;s how control
freaks control.</li>
<li>I put Down to the left of Up because that&rsquo;s how Vim users roll.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Roland Boutique is a series of small form factor electronic music instruments.
The line debuted in 2015 with recreations of three iconic Roland 1980s synths.
I got the JP-08 which I wrote about <a href="/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review/">here</a>. Since then I&rsquo;ve been
watching the series grow with interest.</p>

<p>By now, the <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/promos/roland_boutique/">Boutique line</a> includes nine products recreating
Roland&rsquo;s back catalog: Five subtractive synths (JP-08, JU-06, JX-03, TB-03,
SH-01A), the VP-03 vocoder, the TR-08 and TR-09 drum machines, and finally the
D-05 &ldquo;linear synthesizer&rdquo; mixing sampling and synthesis.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/boutique_hero.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In 2017, Roland ventured outside their own history. Teaming up with Studio
Electronics, they released the Minimoog-inspired analog monosynth SE-02. Having
started down this path, they might make an FM (frequency modulation) synth.
Missing from the lineup is also perhaps a sampler/sample player/sample mangler?</p>

<p></p>

<p>That would at least match miniatures produced by other manufacturers in the
last few years. The very small and affordable Korg Volca series has the
straightforwardly named Beats, Bass, Keys, Sample, and FM. The first four
predated the original Boutique trio by 1-2 years, while the FM was released in
2016.</p>

<p>Swedish manufacturer Elektron also recently went small with the less toylike
&mdash; and less affordable &mdash; Digitakt sampler and Digitone FM-synth, with the
latter being announced just one month ago.</p>

<p>The 2015 Yamaha Reface series also has CS, DX, YC, and CP, doing synth, FM,
electric organ, and electric piano, respectively. And this leads me toward what
I would most like to see in the Roland Boutique series.</p>

<h2>Give Me a Piano!</h2>

<p></p>

<p>When you think of a digital piano, you are more likely to think of 88 weighted
keys than 25 non-weighted &ldquo;synth action&rdquo; minikeys. But one of the advantages of
the Boutiques is that they can both slot into the K-25m keyboard module and
perform as a sound module/desktop synth.</p>

<p>I would love to have a Roland Boutique piano with high-quality, natural,
acoustic piano sounds as well as high-quality electric pianos, organs, strings,
etc. I guess the model number would be in the form of FP-0x or RD-0x. I would
use such a Boutique piano module both as a sound module plugged into a MIDI
keyboard, and in the sofa as a plaything and/or compositional tool with the
K-25m keyboard attached.</p>

<p>The D-05 unfortunately does not fill this role. When the D-50 was launched in
1987 it certainly came closer than any analog synth to sounding like acoustic
instruments, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it could actually pass for one. I went to my
local music store to try out the D-05, and while it does have a dozen patches
with &ldquo;piano&rdquo; in their name, none of them sound like an acoustic piano. It can
do electric pianos and organs, but overall I think the D-50/D-05 has a certain
80s/90s &ldquo;lo-fi&rdquo; sound. It excels at some things, but not acoustic piano.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="The.Panel"></a>
<h2>The Panel</h2>

<p>Some of the Boutiques have too many buttons crammed into the limited space on
the panel. This includes the <a href="/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review/">JP-08</a>, and judging from pictures, also
the TR-08, TR-09 and SE-02. Some have a more reasonable amount, such as the
JU-06, SH-01A, and VP-03. The D-05 doesn&rsquo;t have too many buttons per se, but it
faithfully recreates the dreary menu diving experience of the &ldquo;digital age&rdquo; (to
achieve more hands-on programming of the D-50/D-550/D-05, you need the enormous
PG-1000 programmer). But, digital pianos typically do not have a lot of
buttons. So what do I want on the Boutique piano panel?</p>

<p>I can think of a lot!</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Better speaker(s), perhaps even front facing</li>
<li>Dedicated octave up/down buttons</li>
<li>A good pitch/modulation stick (yes, electric organs can <a href="http://www.organforum.com/forums/showthread.php?22171-Pitch-bending-on-a-Hammond-A-mystery">pitch bend</a>)</li>
<li>Effects! Reverb, Leslie, Overdrive, Chorus, you name it.</li>
<li>Loop machine</li>
<li>Tape recorder</li>
<li>Sequencer</li>
<li>Arpeggiator</li>
<li>Chord memory</li>
<li>Scale/chord library (like a <a href="https://www.islainstruments.com/product/kordbot/">KordBot</a>?)</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, such a module shouldn&rsquo;t be expensive. Unless it would have several of
the above features, it should be closer to 150 €/$ than to 400 €/$. It&rsquo;s
a ripoff that the K-25m keyboard is already 100 €/$.</p>

    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2017/11/19/google-pixel-2-first-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just bought a new smartphone. After three HTC models (Desire Z, One X, One
M8) I decided to go for the pure Android experience with a Google Pixel 2 (I
went with the Clearly White, non-XL version). Here are my thoughts after two
weeks.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/pixel2.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first thing I noticed was the <strong>speed</strong>. Booting it up for the first time
took what I remember as mere seconds. Coming from a 3.5 year old smartphone,
this was a big improvement. Not so relevant on a daily basis, but a good first
impression. But the Pixel 2 also feels very snappy in use, especially compared
with my old smartphone burdened by the newest, hungriest apps.</p>

<p>The second great thing I noticed is the <strong>screen</strong>. It looks fine, but what I&rsquo;m
really happy about is its ability to reduce the brightness to a fairly low
level so I don&rsquo;t get blinded in low light conditions. I guess older OLED
smartphones might have been able to do the same, but it&rsquo;s certainly the first
smartphone I have owned where I have been satisfied with the low brightness
level. The automatic brightness adjustment is also excellent. On top of that,
the Night Light feature is great. As a <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift</a> (similar to
<a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>) user I was happy to see it built in to the OS.</p>

<p>Third, the <strong>battery</strong> life is good. As a test, I skipped charging one night,
and just used it regularly two days in a row. When I went to bed the second
night, it still had 19% left. And that&rsquo;s even with two battery-eating always-on
features enabled: Ambient display (showing date, time, and notification icons)
and Now Playing (which does <em>offline</em> analysis of ambient sound to identify
playing songs).</p>

<a name="The.Stuff.People.Talk.About"></a>
<h2>The Stuff People Talk About</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pixel2front.jpg" width="370"></p>

<p>On-device song identification is pretty cool. Another hypey feature is the
&ldquo;Active Edge&rdquo; which let&rsquo;s you <strong>squeeze</strong> the sides of the phone to activate
Google Assistant. It&rsquo;s fun to play with, but not very useful in my opinion.
I have to shift the phone in my hand to squeeze the right area, and half of the
time, the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the base of my thumb folds up and taps something unwanted
on the screen. So it&rsquo;s better to just launch Assistant the regular way: by long
pressing the home button.</p>

<p>In other news, the <strong>bezels</strong> have taken flak for being too large for 2017. And
I guess they are. On the plus side, I can comfortably reach both top and bottom
of the screen with my thumb, and they have room for front-facing stereo
speakers.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t leave room for a <strong>headphone jack</strong>, though. The phone&rsquo;s packaging
included a (somewhat bulky) converter but no wired USB C headphones &mdash; to get
more people to look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pixel+Buds">Pixel Buds</a>, I guess.</p>

<p>Finally, the Pixel 2&rsquo;s <strong>camera</strong> is supposedly really, really good. I don&rsquo;t
disagree so far, but I&rsquo;ll know more when I get around to trying it somewhere
more picturesque than my desk.</p>

<a name="Small.Annoyances"></a>
<h2>Small Annoyances</h2>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m fairly satisfied with the Pixel 2. But there are a few small
annoyances:</p>

<ul>
<li>No support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast">Miracast</a> - only Chromecast</li>
<li>The Pixel 2 is not officially for sale in Denmark, which means that the
<a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_2">Google Store</a> webpage will not even acknowledge that the Pixel 2 or
its accessories exist, if you access it from Denmark without tricks</li>
<li>The ambient display, which is white text on a black background, <em>strobes</em>,
which you can see when you move the phone around</li>
<li>Dust and debris gets stuck in the speaker grills
<span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/android8_notification_collapse.png' width='' height='' alt='Areas for expanding/collapsing notifications'><span class='caption-text'>Areas for expanding/collapsing notifications</span></span></li>
<li>The device/screen vibrates when the speakers are playing, which can be felt
in the 120&ndash;700 Hz range</li>
<li>The power button and volume rocker require too much pressure to press</li>
<li>Most Android 8 notifications can be expanded/collapsed, to which a large
part of their surface is reserved. This means that unlike older Android
notifications, I kinda have to aim when I tap them.</li>
<li>Going for pure Android is not as cool as I had imagined, and the default
launcher and dialler are disappointing</li>
<li>Since the bezels are there anyway, a fingerprint reader on the front would be
nice, for those times I want to use the phone flat on the table</li>
</ul>


<p>Come to think of it, many of these feel like a step down from my HTC One M8.
But they&rsquo;re not a big problem compared to the improvements in speed, screen
blackness, camera, and battery, all in a thinner, lighter body.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll get to see over the coming months and years if the &ldquo;full Google
experience&rdquo; is worth the price. At least I should be getting updates quickly
for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-2-xl-update-804779/">three years</a>, which is better than many OEMs. I just hope the
Pixel 2 will stay snappy as the updates come.</p>
