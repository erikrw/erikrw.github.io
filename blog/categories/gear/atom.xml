    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I use a weird computer keyboard: The <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage2/">Kinesis Advantage</a>.
It&rsquo;s a concave, columnar, split, tented, mechanical keyboard with thumb keys.
It&rsquo;s very comfortable and much better than anything Logitech or Microsoft have
ever labeled ergonomic.</p>

<p></p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage2.jpg"></p>

<a name="Ergonomic.Features"></a>
<h2>Ergonomic Features</h2>

<p><strong>Columnar</strong> means that the keys are laid out in straight columns, so you don&rsquo;t
have to bend your fingers sideways as you curl and extend them &mdash; unlike on
a standard, staggered keyboard, where especially the left hand fingers need to
move unnaturally. The <strong>split</strong> also helps avoiding sideways bends for the
wrists. For more details, see the illustration of the <a href="https://www.trulyergonomic.com/store/unique-symmetric-columnar-key-arrangement--truly-ergonomic-mechanical-keyboard--orthogonal-matrix-non-staggered">Truly Ergonomic
keyboard</a> (which I haven&rsquo;t tried (yet)).</p>

<p><strong>Tented</strong> means that the thumb side of each hand sits higher than the pinky
side. This gives the wrists a more natural rotation. The Advantage only tilts
20 degrees &mdash; other keyboards such as the
<a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/freestyle2-for-pc-us/">Kinesis Freestyle</a> and the <a href="http://safetype.com">SafeType</a> can tent
(up to) 90 degrees (while <a href="https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/frreestyle2-ascent-90-1.jpg">looking</a> even less
conventional than the Advantage).</p>

<p>The <strong>thumb key</strong> clusters make more keys reachable without moving the hand
away from its home position, and it offloads Backspace and Enter from the
overworked right pinky and onto the stronger thumbs.</p>

<p>The <strong>mechanical</strong> keyswitches (Cherry MX brown or red) register the keypress
when the key is halfway depressed (2 out of 4 millimeters). This is opposed to
standard rubber dome keyboards that require you to bottom out &mdash; fully depress
the key until the finger is jolted to a stop.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage2_side.jpg"></p>

<p>The best feature of the Advantage is the <strong>concave</strong> keywells: The scooped-out
parts of the keyboard where the alphanumeric keys reside. They serve several
purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>As you curl and extend your fingers, the keys remain at the same distance
from your fingertips, so you don&rsquo;t need to stretch your fingers much to
reach. This also makes it easy to access all five (!) rows of keys.</li>
<li>The same happens when you move your index finger to the side (like T, G, B),
reducing sideways-twisting finger motions.</li>
<li>The depths of the columns are matched with the corresponding fingers, so they
all rest naturally in the home position.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Switching"></a>
<h2>Switching</h2>

<p>I got my first Kinesis Advantage in 2011. As I recall, it only took a few days
to adapt to this weird keyboard. The best part is that I can still switch
effortlessly between the Advantage and standard, flat, staggered keyboards. Not
that I particularly enjoy it, but I can do it, which is very practical for
traveling. The Advantage is actually narrower than a standard 104/105-key
keyboard, but it&rsquo;s bigger in the two other dimensions and therefore not easy to
transport.</p>

<p>However, the physical shape of my keyboard is not the only weird thing about my
typing. The <em>logical</em> layout I use &mdash; <a href="/2015/02/27/4-years-with-colemak/">Colemak</a> &mdash; is weird too.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage_custom_keycaps_right.jpg"></p>

<p>Switching logical layout is much harder for me than switching physical layout.
Even though the Advantage is firmware remappable, I set my logical layout in
the computer OS, so I will keep the logical layout for all keyboards, including
the laptop keyboard.</p>

<p>Some people retain their QWERTY touch typing skills while learning an
alternative layout by associating logical layout with physical keyboard, e.g.,
typing Colemak on the Advantage and QWERTY on standard keyboards. And I did
actually get the Advantage the same year I switched to Colemak, but I much
prefer typing Colemak on my laptop while traveling over maintaining my QWERTY
skills.</p>

<a name="Legends"></a>
<h2>Legends</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s not really necessary have Colemak legends on the keys, but I did get a set
of custom keycaps made by <a href="http://www.wasdkeyboards.com/">WASD keyboards</a> for one of my two Advantages
&mdash; complete with my Danish variation of Colemak &mdash; as shown in the images
above and below. It&rsquo;s mostly for show, because the legends are not necessary
for touch typing, and the Advantage is not so good anyway for one-handed use
where the legends might be relevant.</p>

<p>In fact, hunt-and-peck typing is for some reason easier for me with QWERTY
legends, even while I type Colemak. My eyes are more used to the common QWERTY
layout, I guess. I just know that pressing the QWERTY &rsquo;T&#8217; key produces a &lsquo;G&rsquo; in
Colemak. If I look down and the key shows a &lsquo;G&rsquo;, my eyes get confused, even
though my fingers knows exactly where to press to get the &lsquo;G&rsquo; while touch
typing.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/kinesis_advantage_custom_keycaps_left.jpg"></p>

<a name="Downsides"></a>
<h2>Downsides</h2>

<p>The Advantage is not great for everything. Split keyboards are not good for the
occasional one-handed use (e.g., while holding a drink, phone, piece of paper).</p>

<p>The Advantage is not the best for gaming either. The arrow keys are spread on
both sides of the split which is fine for two-handed office and programming
use, but not ideal for gaming. The key positions are matched to finger lengths,
so the WASD keys will not work well with the normal WASD-fingers. ESDF should
be perfect, though.</p>

<p>For a long time, the typical complaint of the Advantage was the low quality of
the rubber F-keys. In 2016, the Advantage2 was launched, with Cherry ML
switches instead of rubber dome F-keys, and more programming options. This is
the product I link to in the top of the post because the product page for the
old version seems to be gone. I haven&rsquo;t tried it, but I can only imagine it&rsquo;s
an improvement.</p>

<p>Another problem partially solved by time is the built-in combined USB hub and
PS/2-to-USB converter. It &mdash; and the whole keyboard with it &mdash; didn&rsquo;t work
with Windows 7. Kinesis did sell a cable conversion kit to work around this,
but I went DIY and installed a PS/2-to-USB adapter myself, bypassing the
problematic USB hub, on my &ldquo;work&rdquo; board.</p>

<p>My &ldquo;home&rdquo; board always worked fine with Linux (and Windows 10), but it&rsquo;s also
not recognized by the BIOS of my desktop computer&rsquo;s motherboard. A smaller
problem but I&rsquo;m considering giving this board a USB hubectomy as well. The
Advantage2 has supposedly also solved this problem.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with the Advantage, but they are minor compared to the
Advantage (heh) of using an extremely comfortable keyboard for my 10+ daily
hours of computer usage.</p>

<a name="Key.Remapping"></a>
<h2>Key Remapping</h2>

<p>My remaining complaints were solved with easy firmware remapping, which is in
fact just a testament to the Advantage&rsquo;s flexibility:</p>

<ul>
<li>I swapped Space and Backspace because I have for some reason always used my
left hand&rsquo;s thumb for Space.</li>
<li>I use the Alt+Tab shortcut all the time, so I moved the Alt key closer to my
thumb in the left thumb cluster.</li>
<li>I made the key above Tab work as an Escape key.</li>
<li>I made the key below Tab work as a Control key because that&rsquo;s how control
freaks control.</li>
<li>I put Down to the left of Up because that&rsquo;s how Vim users roll.</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>Roland Boutique is a series of small form factor electronic music instruments.
The line debuted in 2015 with recreations of three iconic Roland 1980s synths.
I got the JP-08 which I wrote about <a href="/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review/">here</a>. Since then I&rsquo;ve been
watching the series grow with interest.</p>

<p>By now, the <a href="https://www.roland.com/us/promos/roland_boutique/">Boutique line</a> includes nine products recreating
Roland&rsquo;s back catalog: Five subtractive synths (JP-08, JU-06, JX-03, TB-03,
SH-01A), the VP-03 vocoder, the TR-08 and TR-09 drum machines, and finally the
D-05 &ldquo;linear synthesizer&rdquo; mixing sampling and synthesis.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/boutique_hero.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>In 2017, Roland ventured outside their own history. Teaming up with Studio
Electronics, they released the Minimoog-inspired analog monosynth SE-02. Having
started down this path, they might make an FM (frequency modulation) synth.
Missing from the lineup is also perhaps a sampler/sample player/sample mangler?</p>

<p></p>

<p>That would at least match miniatures produced by other manufacturers in the
last few years. The very small and affordable Korg Volca series has the
straightforwardly named Beats, Bass, Keys, Sample, and FM. The first four
predated the original Boutique trio by 1-2 years, while the FM was released in
2016.</p>

<p>Swedish manufacturer Elektron also recently went small with the less toylike
&mdash; and less affordable &mdash; Digitakt sampler and Digitone FM-synth, with the
latter being announced just one month ago.</p>

<p>The 2015 Yamaha Reface series also has CS, DX, YC, and CP, doing synth, FM,
electric organ, and electric piano, respectively. And this leads me toward what
I would most like to see in the Roland Boutique series.</p>

<a name="Give.Me.a.Piano."></a>
<h2>Give Me a Piano!</h2>

<p></p>

<p>When you think of a digital piano, you are more likely to think of 88 weighted
keys than 25 non-weighted &ldquo;synth action&rdquo; minikeys. But one of the advantages of
the Boutiques is that they can both slot into the K-25m keyboard module and
perform as a sound module/desktop synth.</p>

<p>I would love to have a Roland Boutique piano with high-quality, natural,
acoustic piano sounds as well as high-quality electric pianos, organs, strings,
etc. I guess the model number would be in the form of FP-0x or RD-0x. I would
use such a Boutique piano module both as a sound module plugged into a MIDI
keyboard, and in the sofa as a plaything and/or compositional tool with the
K-25m keyboard attached.</p>

<p>The D-05 unfortunately does not fill this role. When the D-50 was launched in
1987 it certainly came closer than any analog synth to sounding like acoustic
instruments, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it could actually pass for one. I went to my
local music store to try out the D-05, and while it does have a dozen patches
with &ldquo;piano&rdquo; in their name, none of them sound like an acoustic piano. It can
do electric pianos and organs, but overall I think the D-50/D-05 has a certain
80s/90s &ldquo;lo-fi&rdquo; sound. It excels at some things, but not acoustic piano.</p>

<p></p>

<a name="The.Panel"></a>
<h2>The Panel</h2>

<p>Some of the Boutiques have too many buttons crammed into the limited space on
the panel. This includes the <a href="/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review/">JP-08</a>, and judging from pictures, also
the TR-08, TR-09 and SE-02. Some have a more reasonable amount, such as the
JU-06, SH-01A, and VP-03. The D-05 doesn&rsquo;t have too many buttons per se, but it
faithfully recreates the dreary menu diving experience of the &ldquo;digital age&rdquo; (to
achieve more hands-on programming of the D-50/D-550/D-05, you need the enormous
PG-1000 programmer). But, digital pianos typically do not have a lot of
buttons. So what do I want on the Boutique piano panel?</p>

<p>I can think of a lot!</p>

<p></p>

<ul>
<li>Better speaker(s), perhaps even front facing</li>
<li>Dedicated octave up/down buttons</li>
<li>A good pitch/modulation stick (yes, electric organs can <a href="http://www.organforum.com/forums/showthread.php?22171-Pitch-bending-on-a-Hammond-A-mystery">pitch bend</a>)</li>
<li>Effects! Reverb, Leslie, Overdrive, Chorus, you name it.</li>
<li>Loop machine</li>
<li>Tape recorder</li>
<li>Sequencer</li>
<li>Arpeggiator</li>
<li>Chord memory</li>
<li>Scale/chord library (like a <a href="https://www.islainstruments.com/product/kordbot/">KordBot</a>?)</li>
</ul>


<p>Finally, such a module shouldn&rsquo;t be expensive. Unless it would have several of
the above features, it should be closer to 150 €/$ than to 400 €/$. It&rsquo;s
a ripoff that the K-25m keyboard is already 100 €/$.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erw.dk/2017/11/19/google-pixel-2-first-impressions/"/>
    <updated>2017-11-19T15:58:03+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2017/11/19/google-pixel-2-first-impressions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just bought a new smartphone. After three HTC models (Desire Z, One X, One
M8) I decided to go for the pure Android experience with a Google Pixel 2 (I
went with the Clearly White, non-XL version). Here are my thoughts after two
weeks.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/pixel2.png"></p>

<!-- more -->


<p>The first thing I noticed was the <strong>speed</strong>. Booting it up for the first time
took what I remember as mere seconds. Coming from a 3.5 year old smartphone,
this was a big improvement. Not so relevant on a daily basis, but a good first
impression. But the Pixel 2 also feels very snappy in use, especially compared
with my old smartphone burdened by the newest, hungriest apps.</p>

<p>The second great thing I noticed is the <strong>screen</strong>. It looks fine, but what I&rsquo;m
really happy about is its ability to reduce the brightness to a fairly low
level so I don&rsquo;t get blinded in low light conditions. I guess older OLED
smartphones might have been able to do the same, but it&rsquo;s certainly the first
smartphone I have owned where I have been satisfied with the low brightness
level. The automatic brightness adjustment is also excellent. On top of that,
the Night Light feature is great. As a <a href="http://jonls.dk/redshift/">Redshift</a> (similar to
<a href="https://justgetflux.com/">f.lux</a>) user I was happy to see it built in to the OS.</p>

<p>Third, the <strong>battery</strong> life is good. As a test, I skipped charging one night,
and just used it regularly two days in a row. When I went to bed the second
night, it still had 19% left. And that&rsquo;s even with two battery-eating always-on
features enabled: Ambient display (showing date, time, and notification icons)
and Now Playing (which does <em>offline</em> analysis of ambient sound to identify
playing songs).</p>

<a name="The.Stuff.People.Talk.About"></a>
<h2>The Stuff People Talk About</h2>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/posts/pixel2front.jpg" width="370"></p>

<p>On-device song identification is pretty cool. Another hypey feature is the
&ldquo;Active Edge&rdquo; which let&rsquo;s you <strong>squeeze</strong> the sides of the phone to activate
Google Assistant. It&rsquo;s fun to play with, but not very useful in my opinion.
I have to shift the phone in my hand to squeeze the right area, and half of the
time, the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of the base of my thumb folds up and taps something unwanted
on the screen. So it&rsquo;s better to just launch Assistant the regular way: by long
pressing the home button.</p>

<p>In other news, the <strong>bezels</strong> have taken flak for being too large for 2017. And
I guess they are. On the plus side, I can comfortably reach both top and bottom
of the screen with my thumb, and they have room for front-facing stereo
speakers.</p>

<p>They didn&rsquo;t leave room for a <strong>headphone jack</strong>, though. The phone&rsquo;s packaging
included a (somewhat bulky) converter but no wired USB C headphones &mdash; to get
more people to look at the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Pixel+Buds">Pixel Buds</a>, I guess.</p>

<p>Finally, the Pixel 2&rsquo;s <strong>camera</strong> is supposedly really, really good. I don&rsquo;t
disagree so far, but I&rsquo;ll know more when I get around to trying it somewhere
more picturesque than my desk.</p>

<a name="Small.Annoyances"></a>
<h2>Small Annoyances</h2>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m fairly satisfied with the Pixel 2. But there are a few small
annoyances:</p>

<ul>
<li>No support for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracast">Miracast</a> - only Chromecast</li>
<li>The Pixel 2 is not officially for sale in Denmark, which means that the
<a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_2">Google Store</a> webpage will not even acknowledge that the Pixel 2 or
its accessories exist, if you access it from Denmark without tricks</li>
<li>The ambient display, which is white text on a black background, <em>strobes</em>,
which you can see when you move the phone around</li>
<li>Dust and debris gets stuck in the speaker grills
<span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/android8_notification_collapse.png' width='' height='' alt='Areas for expanding/collapsing notifications'><span class='caption-text'>Areas for expanding/collapsing notifications</span></span></li>
<li>The device/screen vibrates when the speakers are playing, which can be felt
in the 120&ndash;700 Hz range</li>
<li>The power button and volume rocker require too much pressure to press</li>
<li>Most Android 8 notifications can be expanded/collapsed, to which a large
part of their surface is reserved. This means that unlike older Android
notifications, I kinda have to aim when I tap them.</li>
<li>Going for pure Android is not as cool as I had imagined, and the default
launcher and dialler are disappointing</li>
<li>Since the bezels are there anyway, a fingerprint reader on the front would be
nice, for those times I want to use the phone flat on the table</li>
</ul>


<p>Come to think of it, many of these feel like a step down from my HTC One M8.
But they&rsquo;re not a big problem compared to the improvements in speed, screen
blackness, camera, and battery, all in a thinner, lighter body.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll get to see over the coming months and years if the &ldquo;full Google
experience&rdquo; is worth the price. At least I should be getting updates quickly
for <a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-2-xl-update-804779/">three years</a>, which is better than many OEMs. I just hope the
Pixel 2 will stay snappy as the updates come.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.erw.dk/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review/"/>
    <updated>2017-06-25T17:06:23+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.erw.dk/2017/06/25/roland-jp-08-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the early 1980s Roland produced a number of synthesizers that aged into
classics. The flagship Jupiter-8 is perhaps the most famous, used by electronic
artists such as Jean Michel Jarre, Depeche Mode, and Moby, as well as pop
artists like Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Abba.</p>

<p>Today, a used Jupiter-8 in good condition can cost more than a new top end
modern synthesizer, which is to say a lot. Luckily, in late 2015 Roland
released miniature versions of these classics, at relatively affordable prices.
Jupiter-8 became JP-08, and I got to own a little piece of music history.</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/boutiques.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Three originals (Juno-106, Jupiter-8, JX-3P) above the three new &lsquo;Boutique&rsquo; versions (JU-06, JP-08, JX-03)'><span class='caption-text'>Three originals (Juno-106, Jupiter-8, JX-3P) above the three new &lsquo;Boutique&rsquo; versions (JU-06, JP-08, JX-03)</span></span></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a bit late for a review, one and a half year after the release, but on the
other hand, the Jupiter-8 came out before I was born, so in comparison, the new
version is still very recent!</p>

<!-- more -->


<a name="Sound.in.a.Box"></a>
<h2>Sound in a Box</h2>

<p>One might ask why you need a box like this when you can generate the same
sounds in your computer. But the new Roland releases are in fact just software
in boxes &mdash; digital emulations of the original electronics. The point is that
a box with the right buttons, knobs, and sliders makes the experience of sound
exploration tactile and immediate.</p>

<p>Plus, in this age of multi purpose devices, there is just something fascinating
about a device that does just one thing, does it well, and doesn&rsquo;t let you
connect to Facebook.</p>

<div class="video-container">
<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/C1zdcqoe8qg?feature=player_detailpage" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<a name="A.Small.Box"></a>
<h2>A Small Box</h2>

<p>Compared with the Jupiter-8, the JP-08 is tiny. It has the footprint of an A4
sheet of paper (somewhere between letter and legal for you North Americans),
and that&rsquo;s <em>with</em> the optional mini-keyboard attached. Since it can also be
powered from batteries, that means it&rsquo;s <em>portable</em>. You can bring it on trips,
to the park, or just the sofa. (Or bring it to bed, according to
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/junkiexlofficial">JunkieXL</a>!)</p>

<p>As part of the portability, the unit even has a built-in speaker so you can
play it without attaching a sound system or headphones. As practical as this
is, the speaker has no bass and a tendency to make the chassis rattle and
resonate. So I recommend skipping it altogether because that will sound much
better and make you appreciate the unit more.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/jp-08.jpg"></p>

<a name="Too.Small.a.Box"></a>
<h2>Too Small a Box</h2>

<p>The portable coolness however comes at a cost. To fit all of the controls of
the Jupiter-8 into such a small areal, they have been arranged in two rows.
Thus the sliders only have a throw of 1 cm, which means they require delicate
hand movements. This detracts from the overall hand-on experience, even though
they are usable with patience. The worst part is that it&rsquo;s very hard to sweep
the filter or pulse width smoothly.</p>

<p>However diminutive they are, controls dedicated to exactly one sound parameter
provide much of the immediacy of the overall experience. Unfortunately, the
auxiliary controls are tucked away under button combinations &mdash; a few
labelled, most not.</p>

<ul>
<li>The solo/unison/poly mode buttons have moved from dedicated buttons to
(labelled) combinations. This is acceptable because this is not something
you&rsquo;re likely to need to switch quickly.</li>
<li>The portamento settings also glided (pun intended) into a combination, with
the glide time set by sliding the modulation ribbon with the &lsquo;dual&rsquo; button
held down. This is a bit sad, since I could imaging tweaking the glide time
while playing.</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s worse for features native to the JP-08 such as delay effect parameters,
transpose, pitch bend range, MIDI channel, and especially keyboard octave
selection which is not easily done while playing the mini keyboard.</li>
<li>Also, the pitch bend and modulation features have devolved: The VCO/VCF
destination sliders and selectors have disappeared, and the crude ribbon
makes it difficult to do smooth or precise pitch bends.</li>
</ul>


<p></p>

<a name="Better.With.a.MIDI.Controller"></a>
<h2>Better With a MIDI Controller</h2>

<p>Many of the above problems can be solved by a separate MIDI controller:</p>

<ul>
<li>More octaves can be played directly, or at least octaves can be selected more
easily</li>
<li>Bigger knobs and sliders can be used to obtain smoother sweeps and precise
parameter input</li>
<li>The portamento glide time can be adjusted with a single knob or slider</li>
<li>The Jupiter-8 hold (sustain) feature, missing from the JP-08, can be mapped
to a button</li>
<li>The Jupiter-8 arpeggiator, also sadly missing from the JP-08, can be restored
with an arpeggiating controller such as the Arturia KeyStep</li>
</ul>


<p>Using a separate controller defeats the portability, but seen from the bright
side it just means you can switch between portability and better control.</p>

<a name="Signal.Routing"></a>
<h2>Signal Routing</h2>

<p>Also lost in the miniaturization were the little orange signal routing hints
scattered around the original Jupiter-8 panel:</p>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/jupiter-8-panel.jpg' width='' height='' alt='Image used with permission from Nikolaus Riehm / Studio Repair'><span class='caption-text'>Image used with permission from Nikolaus Riehm / Studio Repair</span></span></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t know of these when I got my JP-08, so it was somewhat confusing. The
source mix knob was the first one I figured out: It mixes between the two only
sound sources &mdash; the two oscillators.</p>

<p>Then there&rsquo;s also routing between the two oscillators. VCO-1 has a &lsquo;cross mod&rsquo;
slider and VCO-2 has a &lsquo;sync&rsquo; switch. What&rsquo;s missing from the panel is the
direction of the routing (and even that routing is going on, if you don&rsquo;t know
what &lsquo;cross mod&rsquo; or &lsquo;sync&rsquo; means).</p>

<p>Cross modulation allows the pitch of VCO-1 to be affected by the pitch of
VCO-2, creating crazy bends or new timbres, depending on the frequency of
VCO-2. Sync allows VCO-2 to return to the start of its cycle at the frequency
of VCO-1, creating new timbres out of existing wave forms. After figuring out
the routing, the JP-08 made a lot more sense.</p>

<p>Perhaps most difficult is keeping track of what the two envelopes control.
ENV-1 can affect the pulse width of both oscillators, the frequency of either
or both oscillators, and the filter cutoff frequency. ENV-2 controls the VCA
and the filter frequency. The filter has a switch choosing which envelope
currently controls the filter.</p>

<h2>Docking Looks Better</h2>

<p><img class="center" src="/images/posts/jp-08_k-25m.jpg"></p>

<p>The JP-08 itself is a sturdy metal panel on top of a plastic box. In its
unmounted form it appears somewhat naked. Adding the optional K-25m keyboard
module really helps completing the look of the device.</p>

<p>Before I got the keyboard module, the device looked somehow messy and
unfinished on my desk. Now, it makes me smile when I look at it. So I&rsquo;m happy
I got the keyboard module even though it is both expensive and only mediocre as
a keyboard. For use mainly with an external keyboard, the synth can also dock
in the keyboard-less, cheaper DK-01 dock.</p>

<p>Also, the metal surfaces have a satisfying ability to not pick up fingerprints.</p>

<h2>More Like JP-04</h2>

<p>The &lsquo;8&rsquo; in Jupiter-8 meant eight voices. The JP-08 only has four voices,
meaning only 4 notes can sound at the same time. This has irritated a lot of
people, including me. I mean, it&rsquo;s not that I play 9th chords all the time, but
Roland, did you really need to go for the minimum effort here, to try to sell
more boxes?</p>

<p>Roland happily claims that you can connect more units to increase the polyphony
by four each time. This is better than nothing, but it&rsquo;s also only partially
true. Because while you can play 4<em>n</em> notes <em>simultaneously</em>, there&rsquo;s still
voice stealing when you play notes sequentially (which is called&hellip; music&hellip;
you might have heard of it, Roland). That means that if you play a sound that
fades out gradually after lifting your finger from the key, that tail will be
cut off by the next note that starts, if no unused voice is available within
the first 4, <strong>not</strong> 4<em>n</em>, voices. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ejpw7GsyAGg">Here&rsquo;s</a> a demonstration.</p>

<p>Since the JP-08 is a (really good) digital simulation of the original analog
electronics, giving it eight voices shouldn&rsquo;t be that hard. Maybe you&rsquo;d need
a better processor, but compared with the costs of development and production,
that cost should be minimal. And you&rsquo;d have happier users. Then perhaps,
instead of buying another JP-08 and feeling like an idiot (which I chose not
to), I might have bought one of the other Boutiques.</p>

<h2>Patch Selection</h2>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/jp-08-16.jpg' width='' height='' alt='The patch selection button rows of the JU-06 and the JP-08'><span class='caption-text'>The patch selection button rows of the JU-06 and the JP-08</span></span></p>

<p>The four voices bring another annoyance, which we need to take a step back to
understand. The Juno-106, JU-06, Jupiter-8, and JP-08 all have 16 buttons used
for patch selection. The JU-06 has eight bank buttons and eight patch buttons,
leading to a total of 64 patches. (The Juno-106, which I own, additionally has
a group selector multiplying everything by two for 128 patches in total.) On
the Juno-106 and JU-06, a single button press can switch the bank number (the
first digit) and the patch number (the last digit) independently (as well as
the group, on the Juno-106), which is very nice. (The Juno-106 also has a patch
increment pedal input, but I digress).</p>

<p>The JP-08 has eight patch number buttons and eight patch preset buttons.
Choosing one of the 64 patches always requires two consecutive presses of the
patch number buttons. A patch preset on the JP-08 is a layering of two patches
sounding simultaneously, and there are only eight of these. This is also how it
was on the Jupiter-8, except that a Jupiter-8 patch preset could also be
a left/right split between two patches instead of a layering.</p>

<p>A patch preset cuts the polyphony in half, since each note you play uses two
voices. Thus, with the JP-08 having only four voices and no split option, patch
presets are much less useful. You can&rsquo;t even play real chords! You can still
play leads and power chords with your layered sound. However, this could be
accomplished with the &lsquo;dual&rsquo; and &lsquo;upper/lower&rsquo; buttons without reserving eight
buttons for patch presets. Instead, it could have used the faster bank+patch
system like the Juno. (Or better yet, it could just have had eight voices.)</p>

<p>There is one final snafu with the 16 buttons and the way they relate to the
delay effect parameters (level, time, and feedback). Because changing the
parameters is difficult while playing, you are not likely to notice it, but
changing the delay time also flushes the delay buffer. However, if you control
the delay parameters with a knob on a MIDI controller, this becomes
embarrassingly obvious.</p>

<a name="In.Conclusion"></a>
<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>The JP-08 is fun and sounds really good. But there are so many things that feel
like they could have been much better with small changes.</p>

<p>Eight voices, obviously. Then the sliders could have been much better with
a small increase in the height of the box. A small increase in width could have
allowed space for direct control of many more parameters. And an arpeggiator!
Not to mention full width keys or more mini keys. A normal pitch bend and mod
stick would also be great, but this might make the unit deeper.</p>

<p>Dimensions multiply, and the unit would quickly become much bigger and less
cute. But it would also be much better and less toy-like. The tiny Boutique
format just seems to go better with machines with fewer controls the Juno-106
or the VP-330.</p>

<p>Seeing newer Boutique releases having features that the JP-08 should have had
also feels like betrayal, after throwing money at a first generation Boutique
model. We&rsquo;re talking tempo synced LFO, tempo synced delay, sequencer note
slides, sequencer song mode, and sequencer <em>parameter locks</em>! It hurts, Roland.</p>
