<div class="entry-content"><p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/casio.jpg" width="345"></p>

<p>The year was 2002 and I had started gymnasium (≈high school). My parents had
bought me the graphic calculator required for our maths classes: Casio fx-9750G
PLUS. It was white and green and curvy and Casio &mdash; not dark and rectangular
and from Texas Instruments, as a calculator was expected to be. Soon, however,
this happy-looking thing became my companion on my journey into the world of
programming.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Compared with a personal computer, this calculator was weak, to say the least.
The display resolution was 128×64 pixels in black and white. (However, I did
for a long time dream of the color LCD version CFX-9850GC PLUS, which could
show <em>three</em> colors:
<span style="color:orange">orange</span>,
<span style="color:green">green</span>, and
<span style="color:blue">blue</span>.)
The processor was slow. Graphing <em>y = x<sup>2</sup></em> took a good five seconds. Sinusoidal
regression on 150 data points took 75 seconds, plus another 8 seconds to draw
the sine curve.
Memory was limited as well: 32K, of which only 28568 bytes were available to
the user. And of which every list and matrix entry took up 10 bytes! Plus, any
time something was graphed, 4K was reserved for that.</p>

<p>Yet for all these complaints, this machine was a fantastic place to start
programming. Having a fixed set of features challenges you to do what you can
with what you have. On this fixed platform, there was no getting lost in
debates about which programming language to use, because there was only one
choice. There was no trouble with installation or incompatible software
libraries. There was no web browsing or multitasking. No distraction. And zero
boot time and a year of battery life.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/casio-fact.jpg"></p>

<p>The basic calculator part is a REPL: That is to say it <em>reads</em> your input,
<em>evaluates</em> it, <em>prints</em> the result, and it <em>loops</em>, doing this indefinitely.
In this interactive environment, you can familiarize yourself with expressions
before slowly, step by step, automating small parts of your calculations. You
could, for example, make a small program that asks the user for input and uses
a loop to do a calculation.</p>

<p>And there were enough features to do really cool things: Plotting, lists and
list operations (sorting, summation, product, mean, median, etc.), matrices and
matrix operations, statistics, regression, etc.</p>

<a name="Programming.on.the.Bus"></a>
<h2>Programming on the Bus</h2>

<p>During the bus trips to school I spent as much time with my Casio as people
today spend with their smartphones. And I suppose this puzzled the other
students: How much time can you really spend calculating?</p>

<p>I made programs for all sorts of tasks. One type was the programs that helped
my maths and science classes. In maths it was nice to be able to enter the
information you had about a triangle, and then calculate the rest
automatically. Or calculate the greatest common divisor. In physics,
I calculated and visualized refraction. In chemistry, I calculated molar
masses.</p>

<p><img class="right" src="/images/posts/casio-guitar.jpg"></p>

<p>But it was also fun and games: I made programs that drew nice geometric shapes
for their beauty. I calculated poker odds. During some boring classes I made
a program in which you entered the time of day (the calculator didn&rsquo;t have
a clock), and it drew a 3d pie chart showing how close the current lecture was
to completion. And I factored out the pie chart so other programs could use it
as a subroutine.</p>

<p>I made programs for sound and music. I translated between notes (such as A) and
frequencies (such as 440 Hz). I visualized harmonics. I made a program that
showed all the ways a chosen note could be played on a guitar. (And
I didn&rsquo;t even play the guitar!)</p>

<p>And I made games. Guess which number I&rsquo;m thinking of, where the program tells
you whether your guess was too high or too low. I made a game in which you had
to remember random numbers that were shown in progressively shorter glimpses.
Each level made the number one digit longer. I made Snake. It grew linearly
slower with the length of the snake, and the game was too slow to be fun to
play. But that didn&rsquo;t affect my pride in making it. Near the end of gymnasium,
I was planning a strategy game inspired by Command &amp; Conquer Tiberian Sun,
which I loved. I had a cool animation for the cyborgs&#8217; machine guns, but other
than that, I never got very far. But to be fair, it is a rather big step from
Snake to that.</p>

<a name="Much.Learnage"></a>
<h2>Much Learnage</h2>

<p>This primitive programming taught me some lessons about &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming:</p>

<ul>
<li>Understanding a program you wrote months ago is tricky, when all variable
names are a single character. I learned the value of descriptive variable
names.</li>
<li>The slow processor gave me a tangible sense of execution time and complexity.</li>
<li>With an editor window of 6x21 chars, I soon learned that sketching your
algorithm or architecture before implementing is useful for big programs.
That would probably take more time to learn on a big screen.</li>
<li>I learned to prioritize what to do with the limited memory.</li>
<li>I learned debugging the hard way: There were almost no meaningful error
messages (but at least you could be taken to the location in the code that
caused the error).</li>
<li>I learned that all programs and subroutines sharing a global address space
sucks!</li>
</ul>


<a name="Interacting.with.the.World"></a>
<h2>Interacting with the World</h2>

<p>After some time, interacting with a program through a (tiny) screen and (tiny)
keyboard was not enough. I wanted to interact with the world. Thankfully, my
parents got me the Casio EA-200 data logger. This device was even clunkier than
the calculator, but it was a window to the physical world: Now I could measure
voltage, light, temperature, and sound.</p>

<p>I measured the fluctuation of the temperature in the fridge. Since I could hear
the compressor swiching on and off I knew the temperature couldn&rsquo;t be constant,
so I wanted to know the extent of the lie that &ldquo;a fridge is 5&#x00b0;C&rdquo;. (As
I recall, it went between 4 and 8&#x00b0;C). Knowledge is power, even in the
small.</p>

<p>With the microphone and speaker, I made a dictaphone. As with Snake, the idea
of making it was more important than its usefulness. It did work, but the
memory was somewhat limited.</p>

<p>I also measured the fluctuation of the intensity of light from lightbulbs. Even
when they appear constantly on, they heat and cool with the alternating current
of the electric grid. And I learned about another &ldquo;truth&rdquo;: Our electric grid
runs at 50 Hz. Yes, when it&rsquo;s not 49 and 52 and 50.2 Hz. This is also where
I got to appreciate the Fourier transform that I recently <a href="/2015/03/20/debugging-complex-numbers/">implemented</a>
myself.</p>

<p>My dear Casio, thanks for the ride.</p>
