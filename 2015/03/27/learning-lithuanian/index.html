<div class="entry-content"><p>Lithuanian is a very old language with connections to Latin, Ancient Greek and
Sanskrit. This quote is <a href="http://termcoord.eu/2014/08/ever-wanted-travel-back-time-talk-lithuanian-3/">attributed</a> to French linguist Antoine
Meillet:</p>

<blockquote><p>Anyone wishing to hear how Indo-Europeans spoke should come and listen to
a Lithuanian peasant.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class='caption-wrapper right'><img class='caption' src='/images/posts/lt-flag.jpg' width='512' height='365' alt='[Lithuanian Embassy Flag] [flickr_flag] by [Mr.TinDC] [flickr_mr] is licensed under [CC BY 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)'><span class='caption-text'><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/3415891618/">Lithuanian Embassy Flag</a> by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mr_t_in_dc/">Mr.TinDC</a> is licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY 2.0</a></span></span></p>

<p>This is in itself very interesting, also because Lithuanian is less well-known,
and has survived bans and attempts of being eradicated in the past. I also have
a personal connection to the language because it is the native language of
<a href="http://www.bachata-geek.me/about-me/">my girlfriend</a> and her family. I am trying to learn it, and while I (slowly)
do so, two things stand out to me:</p>

<p>The first is that in Lithuanian, when you read a word, you know (almost) how to
pronounce it. This is very different from for example English and Danish, where
the connection between writing and pronunciation is complicated and fraught
with exceptions. See for example <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghoti">ghoti</a>, pronounced &ldquo;fish&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The second is that Lithuanian uses seven <em>cases</em>, which means a word has seven
different forms depending on its role in a sentence. A remnant of a case system
is seen in personal pronouns in English: <em>I helped her, and she helped me.</em> &ldquo;I&rdquo;
and &ldquo;me&rdquo;, as well as &ldquo;she&rdquo; and &ldquo;her&rdquo;, have the same &ldquo;meaning&rdquo;, but a different
form depending on roles such as subject and object. In Lithuanian, every noun
and adjective changes depending on role. And these roles include cool things
like being a location or an instrument or means of doing something!</p>

<a name="Writing"></a>
<h2>Writing</h2>

<p>Lithuanian is based on the Latin alphabet, but adds and removes some letters.
My favorites are the three extra consonants &mdash; Č, Š, and Ž &mdash; and their
logic:</p>

<ul>
<li>S is as in most languages: Like the &rsquo;s&#8217; in <strong>s</strong>peak in English.</li>
<li>Š is like the &lsquo;sh&rsquo; in <strong>sh</strong>are, or Engli<strong>sh</strong>.</li>
<li>Z is like a voiced S: Like &lsquo;z&rsquo; in <strong>z</strong>oo.</li>
<li>Ž, similarly, is like a voiced Š: Like the &rsquo;s&#8217; in mea<strong>s</strong>ure, the &lsquo;si&rsquo; in
vi<strong>si</strong>on, or the &lsquo;g&rsquo; in gara<strong>g</strong>e.</li>
<li>C is pronounced like &lsquo;ts&rsquo;, as in roo<strong>ts</strong>.</li>
<li>Č follows the pattern of S/Š and Z/Ž: It&rsquo;s like the &lsquo;ch&rsquo; in <strong>ch</strong>erry.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think it is interesting to have separate letters for these sounds. They are
compact and more predictable than in English where for example &lsquo;ch&rsquo; can be
pronounced as in &ldquo;<strong>ch</strong>erry&rdquo; (the standard č-sound), &ldquo;stoma<strong>ch</strong>&rdquo; (k-sound),
&ldquo;ma<strong>ch</strong>ine&rdquo; (š-sound), or even &ldquo;ya<strong>ch</strong>t&rdquo; (no sound).</p>

<p>That is not to say that they are 100% predictable. Coca-Cola, for example, is
still written Coca-Cola (even though I do enjoy pronouncing it &ldquo;tsotsa-tsola&rdquo;
for fun). But some imported words do change spelling. Can you guess what &ldquo;pica&rdquo;
is? (I&rsquo;d love to have some.)</p>

<p>All in all, the spelling is fairly systematic, but regarding stress/accent,
it&rsquo;s no better than English or Danish. From my Lithuanian book:</p>

<blockquote><p>Rules concerning word stress are really quite complicated in Lithuanian,
unfortunately, so it is best if you try to imitate both pronunciation and
stress [when listening].</p></blockquote>

<p>This is opposed to a language such as Spanish, where accents mark exceptions.
Most unmarked words are stressed on the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable, so
for example if <em>corazón</em> was written without the accent, it should be
pronounced co<strong>ra</strong>zon rather than cora<strong>zon</strong>.</p>

<p>But perhaps technology is changing this. Whereas accents and other
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacritic">diacritics</a> are easy to add in handwriting, it takes
more time on computers and mobile phones, enough that they are often skipped in
casual writing, reducing the logic of the written language, in Spanish as well
as in Lithuanian. But that is all part of the evolution of languages.</p>

<a name="In.Any.Case"></a>
<h2>In Any Case</h2>

<p>In English, words&#8217; roles in sentences (subject, object, etc.) are marked with
word order and prepositions (to, in, on, etc.). But there is another way of
marking them, namely cases. Lithuanian has seven:</p>

<ul>
<li>Nominative &ndash; as subject (unmarked in English)</li>
<li>Genitive &ndash; possessive (of, &rsquo;s)</li>
<li>Dative &ndash; as indirect object (for, to)</li>
<li>Accusative &ndash; as direct object (unmarked in English)</li>
<li>Instrumental &ndash; as instrument/tool/means/company (using, with)</li>
<li>Locative &ndash; location (in)</li>
<li>Vocative &ndash; addressing someone (unmarked in English)</li>
</ul>


<p>Each noun has these seven forms, for example
al<strong>us</strong> (beer),
al<strong>aus</strong> (of beer, beer&rsquo;s),
al<strong>ui</strong> (for beer),
al<strong>ų</strong> (beer as object),
al<strong>umi</strong> (with beer),
al<strong>uje</strong> (in beer),
al<strong>au</strong> (O, beer!).
And then it has another seven forms in plural.
Here follows some examples of case use that I like.</p>

<a name="Examples"></a>
<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>The first is about Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania, and the locative case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vilniaus centre yra daug bažnyčių.</li>
<li>Vilnius-GEN center-LOC are many church-GEN-PLUR.</li>
<li>of-Vilnius in-center are many of-churches.</li>
<li>There are many churches in the center of Vilnius.</li>
</ul>


<p>When I first decoded this sentence I was stoked. It is such a different way of
representing information. Another example I saw in an electrician&rsquo;s advert:</p>

<ul>
<li>Šviesa jūsų projektams.</li>
<li>Light-NOM you-GEN project-DAT-PLUR.</li>
<li>Light of-you for-projects.</li>
<li>Light for your projects.</li>
</ul>


<p>Last Christmas I got a present with a label with a single word on it: <em>Erikui</em>.
It is the dative case of my name so it means &ldquo;for Erik&rdquo;. But this does requires
a name with a special ending to fit into the declension paradigms. My
Lithuanian name is Erikas. Some possible endings are -as, -is, -us (masculine),
and -a and -ė (feminine).</p>

<p>The vocative (addressing) case is especially relevant for names. For example,
my girlfriend&rsquo;s dad&rsquo;s name is Tomas. But to get someone&rsquo;s attention, you use
the vocative: Tomai. This was weird to me at first, but on the other hand, if
you hear your name spoken, you can tell whether people are talking <em>to</em> you or
<em>about</em> you, which is nifty. Here are some examples of the instrumental case:</p>

<ul>
<li>Aš žaidžiu kamuoliu &#8594; I-NOM play ball-INS &#8594; I play with-ball &#8594; I play with a ball</li>
<li>Važiuoju autobusu su tavimi &#8594; (I) go bus-INS with you-INS &#8594; I go by bus with you</li>
</ul>


<p>As you can see in the second example, prepositions are still used. In this case
an explicit &ldquo;with&rdquo; to say &ldquo;with you as a companion&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;with you as
a means&rdquo;. Languages with even more cases such as Finnish and Estonian express
relationships like &ldquo;to&rdquo; and &ldquo;from&rdquo; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locative_case#Estonian">as cases</a>, while they
are prepositions in Lithuanian. In Lithuanian, prepositions can also be
overloaded. For example <em>po</em> + instrumental means &ldquo;under&rdquo; while <em>po</em> + genitive
means &ldquo;after&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Finally, a cute example of the locative:</p>

<ul>
<li>Du viename.</li>
<li>Two-NOM one-LOC.</li>
<li>Two in-one.</li>
<li>Two in one.</li>
</ul>


<a name="Learning.to.Count"></a>
<h3>Learning to Count</h3>

<p>I am fascinated with this case system, but it also takes a considerable amount
of time to build a vocabulary. One thing that is especially hard is counting.
As you have just seen, numbers can be used in the locative. But typically, the
case of the number just matches what it counts. &ldquo;Vien<strong>as</strong> tašk<strong>as</strong>,
penk<strong>i</strong> tašk<strong>ai</strong>&rdquo; means &ldquo;one point, five points&rdquo; in the nominative case.
But as an object in the sentence, it is different:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turiu vien<strong>ą</strong> tašk<strong>ą</strong> &mdash; I have one point (accusative singular)</li>
<li>Turiu penk<strong>is</strong> tašk<strong>us</strong> &mdash; I have five points (accusative plural)</li>
</ul>


<p>And on top of that, the genitive overrides for some numbers, for example those
ending in zero, while those ending in one are singular, even if the number
itself is not:</p>

<ul>
<li>Turiu dešimt tašk<strong>ų</strong> &mdash; I have 10 points (genitive plural)</li>
<li>Turiu dvidešimt tašk<strong>ų</strong> &mdash; I have 20 points (genitive plural)</li>
<li>Turiu dvidešimtvien<strong>ą</strong> tašk<strong>ą</strong> &mdash; I have 21 points (accusative
<em>singular</em>)</li>
</ul>


<p>Then add to that that numbers also decline for gender, and you have not one
word meaning &ldquo;two&rdquo;, but 14 (7 cases * 2 genders). Then you can add the ordinal
(&ldquo;second&rdquo;), which in Lithuanian has 7 cases * 2 genders * 2 numbers
(singular/plural) * 2 forms (pronominal/non-pronominal) + a neuter form =
<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/antras#Declension">57 forms</a>.</p>

<p>On top of the two main types of numbers &mdash; cardinal/quantitative (one, two,
etc.) and ordinal (first, second, etc.) &mdash; Lithuanian has two more. The first
is a &ldquo;super-plural&rdquo; for counting groups and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurale_tantum">plurals-only</a>, which,
in English, are words like scissors, clothes and electronics. The second is
a collective type for the size of groups: Where English speakers can talk about
a pair, a dozen, a hundred, or a million of x, Lithuanians can equally easily
talk about groups of any size.</p>

<a name="The.Beauty"></a>
<h2>The Beauty</h2>

<p>I am told by my better half that the collective numbers are not common in
everyday use, and that probably holds for some of the other grammatical
features I come across as well. But while some people learn about the roots of
Indo-European languages from Latin or Ancient Greek, I do it from Lithuanian.
Plus I learn to speak my girlfriend&rsquo;s language at the same time. And Lithuanian
is great for creating affectionate words! This quote is
<a href="http://termcoord.eu/2014/08/ever-wanted-travel-back-time-talk-lithuanian-3/">attributed</a> to Benjamin W. Dwight:</p>

<blockquote><p>Of all European languages, the Lithuanian has the greatest number of
affectionate and diminutive terms, more than the Spanish or Italian, even
more than Russian, and they can be multiplied almost indefinitely by adding
them to verbs and adverbs as well as adjectives and nouns. If the value of
a nation in the total sum humanity were to be measured by the beauty of its
language, the Lithuanian ought to have the first place among the nations of
Europe.</p></blockquote>
